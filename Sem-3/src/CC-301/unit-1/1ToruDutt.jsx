          that he could stand by while his brother is in peril. Her tone becomes reproachful as she struggles to understand why Laxman remains calm despite her
          desperate pleas.
        </li>
        <li>

          sense of helplessness and despair.

          Stanza 7 Sita implores Laxman to remember his duties as a warrior and as a brother. She appeals to his sense of honor and responsibility, hoping that
          this will finally persuade him to leave and search for Rama.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 8 Sita reflects on her own vulnerability and the consequences if Laxman does not act. She acknowledges her reliance on both Rama and Laxman for
          protection in the forest, portraying herself as defenseless in the face of danger.
