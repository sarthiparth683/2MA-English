          In Nissim Ezekiel's poem Enterprise, there are no explicitly named characters. The poem narrates a symbolic journey undertaken by a group of people,
          and these individuals are described collectively rather than individually. The focus is on their collective experience rather than personal
          identities. However, we can infer their roles and actions based on the poem's content:

        <li>
          The Leader (Unnamed): Role: Guides the group at the beginning of the journey. What they do: Sets the direction for the journey but fades into the
          background as conflicts arise and the group's unity deteriorates.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Group/Companions: Role: Fellow travelers with the narrator. What they do: Initially share enthusiasm for the journey. As challenges arise, they
          become disillusioned and distracted, leading to disagreements and fragmentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Scholar (Unnamed): Role: A member with intellectual pursuits. What they do: Leaves the group early in the journey, possibly symbolizing the
          impracticality of theoretical knowledge in the face of real-world challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Observers/Passersby: Role: Outsiders observing the group's journey. What they do: Represent society or those who remain uninvolved, serving as a
          contrast to the group's struggles. The poem metaphorically explores themes of ambition, human endeavor, disillusionment, and the ultimate realization
          of the futility of materialistic pursuits. The "characters" function more as archetypes than as individuals, allowing the reader to relate the journey
          to universal human experiences.

          <b>Summary:- </b>
        </li>
        <li>Here’s a stanza-wise summary of Nissim Ezekiel's poem "Enterprise", ensuring every aspect is covered:</li>
        <li>
          Stanza 1 The poem begins with a group of people who embark on a journey with a clear sense of purpose. They are united by shared enthusiasm and a
          common goal, driven by a spiritual or intellectual quest. They set out with high hopes, taking the first steps in harmony, and their journey appears
          to be a noble endeavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 2 As they progress, the journey starts revealing its challenges. They encounter mundane yet significant obstacles, such as heat and fatigue.
          Despite these difficulties, they try to maintain their spirits by observing their surroundings. They take note of the landscapes, the behaviors of
          people they meet, and other minor details, which become distractions from their main purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 3 The group’s unity begins to waver as disagreements arise. Ego clashes and differing perspectives create divisions. One member of the group, a
          scholar, decides to leave, signaling the beginning of the disintegration of their collective vision. The departure of this individual creates
          uncertainty and disillusionment among the others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 4 Their journey continues, but the challenges intensify. Natural hardships, such as scorching weather and rough terrain, compound their
          struggles. They also face internal battles, losing sight of their original purpose. The journey, once exciting and inspiring, turns into a burdensome
          ordeal. The poet describes their state as one of despair and loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 5 The travelers reach a point where they are forced to acknowledge their failure. They reflect on the journey and realize that they have
          strayed far from their initial intentions. The trials have tested their endurance and faith, but their goal remains unfulfilled. Some members regret
          having embarked on the journey in the first place.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 6 Finally, the poet brings the group back to where they started. They return home, bruised and battered, having gained nothing of tangible
          value. The journey has taught them lessons about human nature and the futility of their enterprise. The poet concludes by highlighting the irony of
          their quest: despite all their effort, they discover that what they were seeking was never far away—it was within their reach all along.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall Theme "Enterprise" serves as an allegory for human aspirations and endeavors. Ezekiel explores themes of ambition, unity, disillusionment, and
          self-discovery. The poem reflects on the futility of certain pursuits and emphasizes that true fulfillment often lies in introspection and
          self-awareness rather than in external achievements.
