          <b>Characters:-</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          In Jayanta Mahapatra's poem Landscape by the River, the characters and their roles are not explicitly personified in the traditional sense. Instead,
          the poem unfolds as an evocative narrative that uses imagery, settings, and symbolic figures to delve into themes of memory, loss, and the human
          condition. Here’s a breakdown of key elements and implied "characters" or figures:
        </li>
        <li>
          1. The Speaker Role: The observer and narrator of the scene. What they are doing: The speaker reflects on the landscape and the river, interpreting it
          as a site of memory and existential contemplation. They grapple with personal and historical sadness, drawing connections between the land, its
          people, and the passage of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. The River Role: A central symbol and presence. What it is doing: The river represents both a literal and metaphorical flow—of time, memory, and
          life's transience. It silently witnesses the lives and struggles of those who live by it.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. The Old Woman Role: A figure of resilience and suffering. What she is doing: She is described as sitting by the river, embodying the hardships of
          rural life. She may symbolize enduring wisdom, rootedness, or the burden of history.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. The Child Role: A figure of innocence and potential. What they are doing: The child plays near the river, representing hope, naivety, or a fleeting
          moment of joy against the backdrop of the harsh realities surrounding them.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. The Land Role: A silent character, embodying history and culture. What it is doing: The land stands as a witness to the lives of its inhabitants,
          reflecting their struggles, histories, and connections to nature. The poem is deeply symbolic and does not assign conventional character roles with
          defined actions but uses these figures to weave a tapestry of human experience and the natural world. If you'd like, I can analyze specific lines from
          the poem to further clarify these roles.

          <b> Summary:- </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          "Landscape by the River" by Jayanta Mahapatra is a reflective poem that intricately weaves themes of memory, time, nature, and human experiences.
          Below is a stanza-wise summary:
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 1: The poem opens with a serene description of a river flowing quietly. The speaker reflects on the stillness and timelessness of the landscape
          surrounding the river. The tranquility of the scene is imbued with a sense of permanence, yet there is an undercurrent of impermanence in the passing
          of time. This juxtaposition sets the tone for the rest of the poem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 2: The speaker delves into the past, connecting the present landscape with memories of human activity and emotions that once thrived along the
          river. There is a sense of longing as the poet evokes images of life that has now faded, symbolizing the fleeting nature of human existence. The river
          becomes a silent witness to these changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 3: Nature's indifference to human transience is emphasized here. The river continues its journey, unperturbed by the lives and struggles of
          those who inhabit its banks. This stanza captures the eternal flow of nature in contrast to the temporariness of human life, highlighting the
          dissonance between the two.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 4: The poem shifts to a more introspective tone as the speaker contemplates the relationship between the self and the external world. The
          river's presence evokes a meditative state, where the poet grapples with existential questions. The landscape mirrors the speaker's inner thoughts,
          blending the external with the internal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 5: This stanza explores the cultural and historical aspects of the river and its surroundings. The poet reflects on how the river has shaped
          the lives and traditions of the people living nearby. It serves as a repository of collective memory, holding the stories of generations that have
          come and gone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 6: The speaker moves toward a more universal theme, contemplating the role of nature in human lives. The river is portrayed as a symbol of
          continuity and resilience, offering a sense of solace and permanence amidst the chaos of life. However, it also serves as a reminder of life's
          inevitable end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 7: The final stanza returns to the present moment, where the poet acknowledges the unchanging rhythm of the river. There is an acceptance of
          the natural order of life and death, permanence and impermanence. The poem ends on a contemplative note, leaving the reader with a sense of peace and
          reflection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall Themes: Nature and Transience: The river symbolizes the flow of time and the continuity of nature in contrast to the ephemeral nature of human
          life. Memory and History: The landscape serves as a witness to history and the collective memory of people. Existence and Reflection: The poem
          contemplates existential themes, blending the external natural world with internal human emotions. Jayanta Mahapatra's "Landscape by the River" is a
          masterful exploration of these themes, using the river as a central metaphor to connect nature, humanity, and time.
