          <b> Summary:- </b>{" "}
        </li>
        <li>Sure! Here's a stanza-wise summary of the poem "Mahabalipuram" by R. Parthasarathy:</li>
        <li>
          Stanza 1: The speaker begins by describing the ancient city of Mahabalipuram, a place known for its monumental stone temples and sculptures. The city
          is a symbol of the past, where kings and priests once ruled. It is a site that carries a legacy of greatness, yet the ruins speak of decay and the
          passage of time. Summary: The poet paints a picture of Mahabalipuram's glorious past and the present ruins that reflect the impermanence of human
          achievements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 2: The poem shifts to reflect on the mystery of the place. The stone carvings, intricate and timeless, depict stories from mythology. The city
          once witnessed grand rituals and the mighty ocean waves that surged against its shores. Despite its past, the city now stands silent, as though the
          very essence of its past glory has been eroded by time. Summary: The poet reflects on how the once-thriving city now stands silent, with the ocean's
          waves seeming to erode the very fabric of its former magnificence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 3: The poet describes the sculptures of gods and heroes carved into the stones. These figures, though enduring, seem lifeless. There is an
          element of abandonment as the statues stand frozen, untouched by human interaction. The poet sees them as symbols of how history, with its grandeur,
          ultimately fades and becomes a relic of the past. Summary: The statues are presented as lifeless remnants of a lost civilization, symbolizing the
          transience of grandeur and the fading of human achievements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 4: The speaker contemplates the idea of time and its effects on everything. The grandeur of Mahabalipuram may have once been a center of power,
          but now it is only remembered in history. The forces of nature, like the tides of the sea and the winds, have eroded not just the stones but the very
          stories of the past. The poet highlights how time shapes and reshapes everything, making what was once vibrant now seem distant. Summary: The poet
          muses on the passage of time, emphasizing how even the most powerful civilizations are eventually eroded by the forces of nature and time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 5: The poem shifts focus to a philosophical reflection. The speaker realizes that Mahabalipuram, while silent and abandoned now, is a symbol of
          the universal truth of impermanence. The statues, once representations of gods, are now inert. The idea of permanence, in any form, is an illusion,
          and Mahabalipuram, as a city of ruins, illustrates this inevitable reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Summary: The poet concludes with a philosophical observation that the ruins of Mahabalipuram symbolize the impermanence of life and the illusion of
          permanence in human achievements. Overall Summary: Mahabalipuram by R. Parthasarathy reflects on the passage of time and the transient nature of human
          achievements. Through the imagery of ruins, statues, and the forces of nature, the poet explores how grandeur fades into oblivion. The poem suggests
          that history, once vivid and powerful, becomes silent and forgotten over time, urging readers to recognize the fleeting nature of existence and the
          impermanence of all things.
