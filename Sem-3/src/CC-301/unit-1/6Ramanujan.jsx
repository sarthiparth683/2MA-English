          <b>Characters:-</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the poem "A River" by A.K. Ramanujan, there are no explicit characters with specific names or roles. Instead, the poem presents broader entities
          and figures that function as metaphors or represent groups. Hereâ€™s an overview of the "characters" or figures referenced in the poem and their
          symbolic roles:
        </li>
        <li>
          1. The Poets (Old and New) Role: The old and new poets are depicted as observers of the river but are criticized for their indifference and lack of
          genuine engagement with the realities of life. They romanticize the river and its floods, focusing on its grandeur rather than its destructive impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. The River (Vaigai) Role: The river itself is a central figure in the poem. It is described during its dry and flood states. When dry, it reveals
          its bare bones and emptiness, and during floods, it becomes destructive, carrying away lives and causing devastation.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. The Pregnant Woman Role: Symbolizing human suffering and vulnerability, the pregnant woman is swept away by the river during a flood. She
          represents the unnoticed and ignored tragedies in contrast to the poets' glorification of the river.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. The Cows and Twins Role: The cows and unborn twins of the pregnant woman are also victims of the river's floods. They signify the loss of innocent
          lives and the broader consequences of natural disasters.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. The City (Madurai) Role: Though not a character, the city is where the poem is set and symbolizes the cultural backdrop. It represents a space
          where people are desensitized to the suffering caused by the river.
        </li>
        <li>
          Themes Around These Figures: The indifference of people and poets to the pain of others. The contrast between romanticized and realistic portrayals of
          nature. The cyclical nature of human suffering, overlooked by those in positions of privilege or detachment. While there are no detailed, named
          characters, the poem's strength lies in its critique of societal attitudes toward suffering and natural disasters.

          <b> Summary:- </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Summary of A.K. Ramanujan's Poem A River A.K. Ramanujan's A River reflects his keen observation and critique of tradition, contrasting the
          perspectives of ancient poets with contemporary concerns. Through vivid imagery and satirical tones, he discusses the indifference of poets and
          society to human suffering, particularly during natural calamities like floods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 1: The Description of the River in the Summer The poem opens with a serene description of the river Vaigai in Madurai, which flows through the
          city. During the summer, the river is dry, with only the sandbanks visible. The poet describes the dry bed as "the sand ribs" that glisten in the
          sunlight, creating a skeletal appearance. The bridges stretch over the river, creating shadows on the empty riverbed. The imagery is stark, drawing
          attention to the desolate appearance of the river in summer. Ramanujan notes that the dry riverbed often becomes a place for cattle to graze and for
          casual visitors. This sets the tone for the poem's focus on the changing states of the river and people's responses to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 2: Poets' Celebration of the Flood Here, Ramanujan shifts focus to the poets of Madurai, who have written about the river only when it floods.
          He criticizes both past and present poets for their lack of originality, as they describe the floods in predictable terms, focusing on the grandeur
          and destruction brought by the overflowing river. Ramanujan sarcastically highlights how the poets celebrate the same cliched images, such as water
          carrying away "three village houses, one pregnant woman, and a couple of cows." Their verses glorify the drama of the floods but ignore the human
          suffering behind it, revealing a detachment from reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 3: The Flood's Devastation The stanza delves deeper into the aftermath of the floods, portraying the destruction caused by the overflowing
          river. The poet recounts how the river, during the monsoon, rises to the edges of the steps, submerging everything in its path. The devastation
          includes not only material loss but also human tragedy. The line about the "pregnant woman" being swept away underscores the indifference of the poets
          and society, who romanticize such suffering instead of empathizing with it. Ramanujan questions the morality of celebrating natural disasters without
          acknowledging their impact on ordinary lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 4: A Modern Poet's Perspective In this stanza, the poet contrasts the attitude of the older poets with that of modern ones. Ramanujan laments
          that even the contemporary poets have not moved away from the traditional way of glorifying the river. They continue to describe the floods using the
          same images and themes, failing to bring a fresh or empathetic perspective. The critique here is clear: poetry should evolve and address the real
          concerns of the people, rather than adhering to outdated and superficial conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanza 5: The Irony of the River's Duality The final stanza emphasizes the duality of the river, which is dry and barren during summer but becomes a
          source of destruction during the monsoons. Ramanujan uses this duality as a metaphor for society's indifference to suffering, whether in times of
          scarcity or abundance. The river symbolizes the apathy of poets and the public, who fail to see beyond its aesthetic or dramatic appeal. The poem
          concludes with a stark critique of how the past and present have overlooked the lives and struggles of common people, choosing instead to focus on the
          grandeur of the natural phenomenon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Themes in the Poem Indifference to Suffering: The poem critiques how poets and society are detached from the real suffering caused by floods, focusing
          instead on the river's dramatic and aesthetic aspects. Tradition vs. Modernity: Ramanujan contrasts the ancient poets with contemporary ones, finding
          both lacking in originality and empathy. Symbolism of the River: The river serves as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of life and society's apathy
          toward human suffering. Critique of Poetic Conventions: The poem critiques traditional poetic conventions that glorify nature without addressing its
          real impact on people's lives. Through vivid imagery and a satirical tone, Ramanujan challenges readers to rethink their perspectives on nature,
          tradition, and human empathy.
