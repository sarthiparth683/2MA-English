          <b> Summary</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          R.K. Narayan’s "An Astrologer's Day" is a short story from his collection Malgudi Days. The story unfolds in a single day, focusing on an astrologer
          whose life takes an unexpected turn. Here’s a detailed summary, organized act-wise:
        </li>
        <li>
          Act I: Setting and Introduction The story opens in a busy marketplace in the fictional town of Malgudi, where an astrologer sets up his practice under
          a tamarind tree. The scene vividly describes the hustle and bustle of the market, with vendors selling various goods and a general cacophony. The
          astrologer, though untrained, is skilled at reading people’s faces and giving vague but convincing advice. He dresses in a way to appear mystical,
          with sacred ash and a turban, which lends him an aura of authority. His "prophecies" are based on shrewd observations of human nature rather than
          astrological calculations. Key Details: The astrologer doesn’t believe in astrology but is adept at fooling his clients. He relies on intuition and
          his ability to read emotions and social cues. The marketplace setting underscores the vibrant and chaotic backdrop of Malgudi.

          Act II: The Arrival of the Mysterious Client As the day progresses and night falls, the astrologer prepares to pack up. Suddenly, a mysterious
          stranger appears. This man, described as rough and intense, challenges the astrologer to prove his skills. The astrologer is initially hesitant but
          accepts the challenge because the man insists and offers money. The stakes are high—if the astrologer fails, he will be humiliated. Key Details: The
          stranger’s demeanor is intimidating, and his aggressive behavior unsettles the astrologer. The astrologer carefully probes the man’s appearance and
          mannerisms to gather clues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act III: The Revelation The astrologer begins his reading and surprises the stranger by accurately describing his troubled past. He says: The man was
          once stabbed and left for dead in a quarrel. The person responsible for the attack fled, thinking the man was dead. The stranger is astonished by this
          accuracy and confirms that he had indeed been attacked years ago. Fueled by rage, he declares his intention to find and kill the perpetrator, whom he
          believes is still alive. At this point, the astrologer shocks the man further by revealing that the assailant is already dead. He explains that the
          attacker met a violent death under a lorry. This revelation pacifies the stranger, who feels a sense of closure. The stranger pays the astrologer and
          departs. Key Details: The astrologer’s knowledge is not based on astrology but on his personal history. He was, in fact, the attacker who had stabbed
          the stranger years ago. The stranger’s belief in the astrologer’s words prevents further violence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act IV: The Astrologer’s Confession After the stranger leaves, the astrologer packs up and returns home. He shares the incident with his wife,
          revealing his dark secret: He had once lived a reckless life and had stabbed a man during a drunken brawl, leaving him for dead. He fled to Malgudi,
          changed his identity, and became an astrologer to escape his past. The astrologer expresses relief that he has finally atoned for his crime. By
          deceiving the stranger into believing the assailant is dead, he avoids retaliation and ensures the stranger finds peace.
        </li>
        <li>
          Key Details: The astrologer feels a weight lifted off his shoulders after this encounter. His wife, who had no knowledge of his past, is shocked but
          remains supportive. Themes and Analysis Irony: The astrologer’s career is built on deception, yet it saves him from his own past. Fate vs. Free Will:
          The story explores whether our lives are governed by fate or shaped by our actions. Redemption: The astrologer’s confrontation with his past allows
          him to find redemption and closure. The story’s twist ending and Narayan’s simple yet evocative prose make "An Astrologer’s Day" a compelling tale of
          human nature and destiny.
