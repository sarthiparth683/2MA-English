        <li>
          3. Arjuna Role: The third Pandava, a great warrior and archer. What he is doing: Like Bhima, Arjuna also ignores the Yaksha's warning and drinks from

          6. Yaksha Role: The guardian spirit of the enchanted pool. What he is doing: The Yaksha tests the wisdom and virtue of the Pandavas by posing riddles

          Key Events in the Story The Pandavas, weary and thirsty during their exile in the forest, search for water. One by one, the brothers drink from the
          enchanted pool without heeding the Yaksha's warning and fall unconscious. Yudhishthira arrives, engages with the Yaksha, and answers the challenging
          questions posed. The Yaksha reveals his true form as Yama (the god of death and Yudhishthira's father), commends Yudhishthira's wisdom, and revives
          the Pandavas.

          Here’s a detailed act-wise summary of “The Enchanted Pool” by C. Rajagopalachari, based on his retelling of the Mahabharata. This story is also
          referred to as The Story of Yudhishthira and the Yaksha. It is a moral and philosophical tale that occurs during the Pandavas' exile in the forest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act 1: The Search for Water Setting: The Pandavas are in exile, wandering in the forest. Inciting Incident: The five brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima,
          Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva—become exhausted and thirsty during their journey. Conflict Begins: Nakula is sent to find water. He discovers a clear
          pool but hears a celestial voice (Yaksha) warning him not to drink the water without answering its questions. Ignoring the warning, Nakula drinks the
          water and falls unconscious.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act 2: The Fall of the Brothers Rising Tension: When Nakula does not return, Sahadeva is sent to check. He also finds the pool, hears the Yaksha’s
          warning, and drinks the water without answering. He too collapses. Arjuna and then Bhima follow, facing the same fate, as they also dismiss the
          Yaksha's warning and try to quench their thirst.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act 3: Yudhishthira Faces the Yaksha Climactic Encounter: Yudhishthira, the eldest and wisest of the brothers, goes to the pool. He sees his
          unconscious brothers and the Yaksha, who reiterates the warning. Unlike his brothers, Yudhishthira respects the celestial being’s authority and agrees
          to answer its questions before drinking the water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act 4: The Questions of the Yaksha Moral and Philosophical Questions: The Yaksha poses several profound and moral questions to Yudhishthira. These
          questions cover themes of ethics, human nature, duties, and life’s mysteries. Some examples of the Yaksha’s questions include: "What makes the sun
          rise?" "What is faster than the wind?" "Who is truly happy?" "What is the greatest wonder in the world?" Yudhishthira answers each question with
          wisdom and insight. For example, to "What is the greatest wonder?" he responds that humans see death every day but still live as though they are
          immortal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Act 5: The Restoration Resolution: Impressed by Yudhishthira’s wisdom and humility, the Yaksha reveals its true identity: it is Yama, the god of death
          and justice, who is also Yudhishthira’s father in disguise. Yama offers to revive one of the brothers as a reward for Yudhishthira’s virtue.
          Yudhishthira chooses Nakula, the son of Madri, to maintain fairness between the two mothers, Kunti and Madri. Pleased by his sense of justice and
          impartiality, Yama revives all four brothers and blesses the Pandavas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Themes and Lessons Obedience and Wisdom: Yudhishthira’s respect for authority contrasts with the impulsiveness of his brothers. Justice and Fairness:
          Yudhishthira’s decision to revive Nakula reflects his commitment to justice and equality. The Nature of Life: The Yaksha’s questions highlight
          profound truths about life, death, and human ignorance. This story is a pivotal episode in the Mahabharata and illustrates the virtues of wisdom,
          humility, and righteousness embodied by Yudhishthira.
