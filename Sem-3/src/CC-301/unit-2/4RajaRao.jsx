        lowest social stratum. Her life revolves around serving her employers and providing for her young son. Her Employer’s Family: The Brahmin family Javni
        works for is traditional yet struggling economically. Despite their financial hardships, they adhere to rigid caste norms, treating Javni as an
        untouchable. Daily Struggles: Javni’s laborious life involves fetching water, cleaning, and other menial tasks. She endures insults and discrimination
        with quiet resilience, representing the silent suffering of many marginalized individuals.

        desperation to save him underscores her maternal instincts and helplessness in the face of poverty. The Brahmin Family’s Indifference: Javni seeks help
        from her employers, but they show little concern for her plight. Their apathy highlights the deep-seated insensitivity bred by caste prejudice. Seeking
        Aid Elsewhere: With no support from the Brahmin household, Javni turns to the local community. Her attempts are met with partial success, showing the
        fractured solidarity among the poor.
