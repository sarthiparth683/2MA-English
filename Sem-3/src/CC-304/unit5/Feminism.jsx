          1. Feminism in Literature Feminism in literature examines the roles, experiences, and representation of women, often highlighting their oppression
          under patriarchal structures. Feminist criticism emerged in the 1960s and 1970s alongside the second-wave feminist movement. Key Figures and Works:
          Mary Wollstonecraft: A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), advocating for women’s education. Simone de Beauvoir: The Second Sex (1949),
          analyzing the concept of "Othering" in relation to women. Virginia Woolf: A Room of One's Own (1929), exploring the economic and social conditions
          necessary for female creativity. Objectives: Challenge the marginalization of women in literature. Reinterpret texts to uncover female voices and
          experiences. Critique gender stereotypes and patriarchal ideologies in texts. Key Concepts: Gynocriticism: Elaine Showalter's term focusing on the
          study of women’s writing. Intersectionality: Examining how race, class, and sexuality intersect with gender oppression. Applications in Literature:
          Feminist criticism has re-evaluated works like Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë, emphasizing Jane's struggle for autonomy, or The Awakening by Kate
          Chopin, highlighting themes of female independence.

          2. Postcolonialism Postcolonialism critiques the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism, focusing on the human consequences of external
          control and exploitation. Key Thinkers and Texts: Frantz Fanon: The Wretched of the Earth (1961), examining decolonization and cultural alienation.
          Edward Said: Orientalism (1978), critiquing Western representations of the East. Homi K. Bhabha: The Location of Culture (1994), discussing hybridity
          and cultural identity. Central Themes: Hybridity: The blending of colonizer and colonized cultures, resulting in new identities. Mimicry: Colonized
          individuals imitating the colonizer’s culture, often to subversive ends. Subaltern: Gayatri Spivak’s term for marginalized voices excluded from
          dominant discourse. Key Applications: Postcolonial analysis of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart examines the disruption of Igbo society by colonial
          forces. Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children reflects on the complex identity of postcolonial India.

          3. Psychoanalytic Theory and Criticism Psychoanalytic criticism, grounded in Sigmund Freud’s theories, explores the unconscious motives of characters
          and authors and the psychological impact of literature on readers. Key Concepts: Freud's Theory: Id, Ego, Superego: Representing primal desires,
          rational thought, and moral constraints. Oedipus Complex: A child’s subconscious sexual desire for the opposite-sex parent. Repression: The
          unconscious suppression of desires and memories. Carl Jung: Archetypes: Universal symbols (e.g., the hero, the shadow) recurring in literature.
          Collective Unconscious: Shared reservoir of human experiences and emotions. Key Thinkers: Jacques Lacan: Explored the "mirror stage" and the symbolic
          order, connecting language to identity formation. Julia Kristeva: Powers of Horror (1980), analyzing abjection and the breakdown of boundaries.
          Applications in Literature: Shakespeare’s Hamlet is often analyzed through the Oedipus complex. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein can be seen as a study of
          repressed desires and the "monster within."

          4. Orientalism Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978) critiques how the West has historically constructed the East as the "Other"—exotic, irrational, and
          inferior. Key Concepts: Binary Opposition: The West is portrayed as rational and superior, while the East is depicted as mysterious and backward.
          Imperial Gaze: The way colonial powers viewed and represented the colonized as subjects of study or control. Othering: A process of dehumanizing or
          exoticizing those deemed "different." Impact: Orientalism shaped Western literature, art, and academia by reinforcing stereotypes about Asia, the
          Middle East, and Africa. Applications: The portrayal of Eastern characters in texts like A Passage to India by E.M. Forster reflects Western biases.
          Analysis of The Arabian Nights showcases how Eastern stories were appropriated and recontextualized for Western audiences.

          5. Eco Criticism Eco-criticism examines the relationship between literature and the natural environment, often critiquing human-centered
          (anthropocentric) perspectives. Key Thinkers: Cheryll Glotfelty: Co-editor of The Ecocriticism Reader (1996), which introduced the field. Lawrence
          Buell: Explored the ethics of environmental representation in literature. Central Themes: Pastoralism: Romanticized depictions of rural life and
          nature. Environmental Justice: Highlighting the impact of environmental issues on marginalized communities. Deep Ecology: Advocating for the intrinsic
          value of nature beyond human utility. Applications: William Wordsworth’s poetry emphasizes the spiritual connection to nature. Rachel Carson’s Silent
          Spring critiques the environmental impact of pesticides, blending scientific and literary writing. Contemporary Relevance: In the age of climate
          change, eco-criticism engages with texts like Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake, which warns of ecological collapse.

          Conclusion Each of these critical frameworks enriches our understanding of literature by uncovering hidden dimensions—whether related to gender,
          colonial history, psychological depth, cultural representation, or environmental consciousness. Combining these approaches allows for a multifaceted
          analysis that resonates with contemporary concerns.
