        1. Structuralism Definition and Origins: Structuralism is a theoretical framework that emerged in the early 20th century, originating from linguistics,
        particularly the work of Ferdinand de Saussure. It focuses on the underlying structures that govern cultural products, such as language, literature, and
        myths. Structuralists believe that meaning is derived not from individual elements but from their relationship within a system. Key Concepts: Sign,
        Signifier, and Signified: Saussure argued that language is a system of signs, where the signifier (sound or image) and the signified (concept) together
        create meaning. Binary Oppositions: Structuralism identifies contrasting pairs (e.g., good vs. evil) as fundamental to understanding meaning in
        literature and culture. Langue and Parole: Langue refers to the overarching system of language, while parole represents individual expressions within
        it. Application in Literature: Structuralist critics analyze texts to uncover their deep structures, focusing on how narratives are organized. For
        instance, Roland Barthes examined myths and literature as cultural sign systems. Example: Vladimir Propp's study of Russian folktales categorized
        recurring narrative functions, such as the hero's journey, which can also apply to other genres. Criticism: Structuralism is often criticized for being
        overly deterministic, ignoring individual creativity and historical context in favor of universal structures.

        2. Modernism Definition and Historical Context: Modernism was a cultural and literary movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
        particularly after World War I. It was a response to the disillusionment with traditional values, conventions, and the rapid industrial and
        technological changes of the time. Key Features: Experimentation: Modernist writers broke away from traditional narrative structures, employing
        stream-of-consciousness, fragmented timelines, and nonlinear storytelling. Subjectivity: A focus on individual consciousness and internal experiences
        became central, reflecting the complexities of the human psyche. Alienation and Dislocation: Themes of isolation and estrangement were prevalent,
        reflecting societal discontent. Intertextuality and Allusions: Modernist works are often dense with references to classical and contemporary texts.
        Major Writers and Works: James Joyce: Ulysses uses stream-of-consciousness to explore the inner lives of its characters. Virginia Woolf: In To the
        Lighthouse and Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf employs experimental narrative techniques to delve into human consciousness. T.S. Eliot: The Waste Land reflects the
        fragmented post-war world through its innovative use of imagery and structure. Significance: Modernism reshaped literature by challenging conventional
        forms and engaging with themes of modern existence, identity, and the search for meaning.

        3. Postmodernism Definition and Context: Postmodernism emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction against the certainties and structures of
        Modernism. It reflects a skeptical and playful approach to grand narratives, emphasizing pluralism and fragmentation. Key Features: Metafiction:
        Postmodern works often self-consciously reflect on their own artificiality (e.g., Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five). Intertextuality: Borrowing and
        blending of styles and genres are common, as seen in Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea, a prequel to Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre. Fragmentation: Narrative
        and character are often disjointed, mirroring the fragmented nature of reality. Pastiche and Parody: Postmodernism frequently employs humor, irony, and
        parody to question authority and meaning. Thematic Concerns: Relativism and Subjectivity: There is no singular truth or meaning; everything is open to
        interpretation. Rejection of Metanarratives: Postmodernism critiques overarching ideologies and structures, such as progress and enlightenment. Notable
        Writers and Works: Thomas Pynchon: Gravity's Rainbow is a hallmark of postmodern complexity. Don DeLillo: White Noise critiques contemporary consumer
        culture. Margaret Atwood: The Handmaid's Tale employs postmodern techniques to address dystopian themes. Criticism: Postmodernism is often criticized
        for its perceived nihilism, lack of coherence, and reluctance to engage with moral or political commitments.

        4. Poststructuralism Definition and Evolution: Poststructuralism arose as a critique of Structuralism in the late 20th century, influenced by
        philosophers like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Roland Barthes. It challenges the notion of fixed structures and stable meanings. Key Concepts:
        Deconstruction: Derrida’s idea of deconstruction reveals inherent contradictions and ambiguities within texts, showing that meaning is always deferred.
        Death of the Author: Roland Barthes argued that the author’s intentions are irrelevant; meaning is created by the reader. Power and Discourse: Michel
        Foucault emphasized how language shapes power dynamics and knowledge systems. Application in Literature: Poststructuralist critics focus on how texts
        subvert their own claims to truth or stability, often unraveling hierarchical oppositions (e.g., male/female, reason/emotion). Example: In Joseph
        Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, a poststructuralist reading might explore how the narrative undermines its critique of colonialism. Impact:
        Poststructuralism has influenced a wide range of disciplines, encouraging a focus on interpretation, ambiguity, and the interplay of language and power.
        Criticism: Poststructuralism is criticized for its complexity, relativism, and potential for endless deferral of meaning.

        Conclusion Each of these movements—Structuralism, Modernism, Postmodernism, and Poststructuralism—has profoundly shaped literary criticism and theory.
        They reflect evolving understandings of language, culture, and the human experience, offering diverse lenses through which literature can be
        interpreted.
