    <h1>1. What is Language? Artificial and Natural Language.</h1>
    <br />
    <b> Ferdinand de Saussure. </b>

    <p>
      <b>Language:-</b> It's a structured system of communication used by humans
      to convey meaning, and also to express feelings, thoughts and emotions.
      <br />
      Characteristics:<br />
      Grammar and Vocabulary: Language consists of rules (grammar) and a set of
      words (vocabulary).<br />
      Spoken and Written Forms: <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Natural language and artificial language: </b> <br />
      <b> Natural Language:-</b> Natural language refers to the languages that
      humans use for everyday communication and evolved organically. These
      languages have evolved organically over time within human societies.
      Natural languages are rich, with extensive vocabularies, grammar rules,
      and nuances(Saying "good" vs. "great": Both words mean something is
      positive, but "great" has a stronger nuance),natural languages are organic
      and dynamic, reflecting the complexities of human thought and culture.
      <br />
      Examples of Natural Language: English, Spanish, Mandarin, etc.<br />
      <br />

      <b>Artificial Language:- </b> Artificial languages are created for
      scientific or technological purposes. Their design often connects closely
      with logical theory. <br />
      Examples: Constructed languages: Esperanto, Klingon (from Star Trek)
      Programming languages: Python, Java, C++.
    </p>

    <h1>
      2. Language and Society, Language and Culture, Characteristics of human
      language.
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b>Language and Society:</b>
      Language varies significantly based on cultural context.Each influences
      the other.It focuses on how language reflects, shapes, and is shaped by
      various social factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Language and Culture:- </b>Language gives us a sense of identity and
      belonging within our cultural group.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Characteristics of human language:- </b> <br />
      Arbitrariness: Words and their meanings are arbitrary. There is no
      inherent connection between the sound of a word and its meaning. <br />
      Discreteness: Language consists of discrete units (phonemes, morphemes,
      words) that can be combined to create infinite meanings. <br />
      Productivity (Creativity): Humans can generate sentences infinitely.
      <br />
      Cultural Transmission: Language is learned from others in our culture.
      It’s passed down through generations.
    </p>

    <h1>3. Difference between human language and animal communication.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Human Language:</b> Human language is a sophisticated(High class or
      level) system of communication that allows individuals to convey thoughts,
      feelings, ideas, and intentions. It goes beyond mere words and encompasses
      a broad range of symbolic elements, both spoken and written, that carry
      meaning. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Animal Communication:</b> In contrast, animal communication is more
      limited. It involves specific signals or behaviors that animals use to
      convey information to others of their species.
    </p>

      4. What is linguistics? Linguistics as a scientific study of language.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Linguistics is the scientific study of language. It delves into the
      various aspects of human language, including its structure, meaning,
      usage, and history. Linguists, the individuals who study linguistics,
      employ scientific methods to analyze and understand the complexities of
      language.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Phonetics and phonology:- </b> These subfields examine the production
      and perception of speech sounds, as well as
      <u>how these sounds are organized </u> within a language system. <br />
      <b>Morphology:- <sub>m!w</sub> </b> This area explores the
      <u> structure of words</u>, including how morphemes (the smallest
      meaningful units of language) are combined to form words. <br />
      <b>Syntax:- <sub>s=s</sub> </b> Syntax focuses on the rules and principles
      governing <u>how words are arranged to form sentences.</u> <br />
      <b>Semantics:- <sub>man=meng</sub> </b> This subfield investigates the
      <u>meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. </u> <br />
      <b> Pragmatics:- </b> How language is used w.r.t. speaker's intent and
      listener's background.
    </p>

    <h1>5. Scope of linguistics.</h1>
    <p>
      Linguistics is the <u> building blocks of language, </u> ranging from the
      smallest unit of sound (phonetics) to the organization of words in
      sentences (syntax), <br />
      <b>
        Phonetics (sounds), Phonology (sound), morphology (word structure),
        syntax (sentence structure), and semantics (meaning). Pragmatics (how
        language is used w.r.t. speaker's intent and listener's background. )

        geographical regions ), <br />
        Psycholinguistics( exploring how we acquire, process, and use language.)
      </b>
      <br />
      <b>Neurolinguistics: </b>focusing on how the brain processes and uses
      language <br />
      <b> Historical linguistics</b> evolution of languages uncovering
      historical relationships . <br />

    <h1>8. Diachronic and Synchronic linguistics.</h1>
    <p>
      <b> 1. Diachronic Linguistics (Historical Linguistics):</b> <br />
      Focuses on the evolution and change of language over time. <br />
      Studies how languages develop, borrow elements from other languages, and
      transform their structure and vocabulary throughout history. <br />
      Analysis to reconstruct past language forms and trace their evolution.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b>
        2. Synchronic Linguistics (specific point, Short-term, Grammatical
        analysis):
      </b>
      <br />
      Concentrates on describing the structure and function of a language at a
      specific point in time. <br />
      Aims to understand how a language works as a system at a particular
      moment. <br />
      Focuses on grammar, morphology, syntax, and semantics to analyze how
      elements within a language system interact and create meaning. <br />
      Ignores the historical development of the language, treating it as a
      static system for the chosen timeframe. <br />
    </p>

    <h1>9. Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic relationships.</h1>
    <p>
      <b> 1. Syntagmatic Relationships (Horizontal Axis):</b> <br />
      Focus on the linear order and co-occurrence of words within a sentence or
      phrase. <br />
      Describe - how words combine and sequentially depend on each other to form
      grammatical and meaningful units. <br />
      Analyze the horizontal axis of language, where words are arranged in a
      specific order to convey meaning. <br />

      Examples: <br />

      "The red car drove down the street." In this sentence, "the," "red,"
      "car," "drove," "down," and "the street" all have syntagmatic
      relationships with each other, forming a grammatically correct and
      meaningful sentence. <br />
      <br />

      <b> 2. Paradigmatic Relationships:</b> <br />
      Focus on the substitutability of words within the same grammatical
      category or word class. <br />
      Explore how words with similar meanings or functions can be interchanged
      in a sentence while maintaining grammatical correctness, but potentially
      altering the meaning or emphasis. <br />
      Analyze the vertical axis of language, where words from the same category
      (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) can be substituted for each other. <br />
      <br />
      Examples: <br />

      "The big dog barked loudly." In this sentence, "big" could be replaced
      with other adjectives like "large," "giant," or "enormous" while
      maintaining grammatical correctness. These words have a paradigmatic
      relationship as synonyms within the adjective category.
    </p>

    <h1>10. Langue and Parole.</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Langue:- </b> <br />
      Langue refers to the abstract, systematic rules and structures that govern
      a language. It encompasses the underlying principles of a signifying
      system, independent of any individual user. <br />
      It precedes individual usage and provides the foundation for meaningful
      communication. <br />
      Langue includes grammar, syntax, phonology, and vocabulary—the essential
      components that shape a language. <br />
      Example: When we study the grammatical rules of English or analyze its
      phonetic patterns, we are exploring the realm of langue. <br /><br />

      <b> Parole:- </b> <br />
      Parole refers to the concrete instances of language use—the actual speech
      acts, written texts, and utterances produced by individuals. <br />
      Concrete: Parole manifests in real-world communication, whether spoken or
      written. <br />
      Variability: Each individual’s parole may differ due to personal style,
      context, and intention. <br />
      Research Material: Linguists analyze parole to understand how langue
      operates in practice. <br />
      Example: When you engage in a conversation, write a poem, or deliver a
      speech, you are expressing parole.
    </p>

    <h1>11. Competence and Performance</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Competence (Knowledge): </b> <br />
      Competence refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities that an
      individual possesses. <br />
      It represents the theoretical understanding and capacity to perform tasks
      within a specific domain. <br />
      Example: <br />
      When someone has linguistic competence, they understand the grammar,
      vocabulary,Phonology, Sementics, and syntax of a language. This knowledge
      enables them to communicate effectively. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Performance(Execution of Knowledge):- </b> <br />
      Performance refers to how well an individual applies their competencies in
      real-world situations. It involves the actual execution of tasks or
      behaviors. <br />
      It encompasses actions, behaviors, and practical demonstrations. <br />
      Example:speaking, writing, Listening, Reading...etc..
    </p>

    <h1>12. Substance and Form.</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Substance:- </b> <br />
      In spoken language,it is sound waves, made up of phonemes (smallest units
      of sound that distinguish meaning). <br />
      In written language, it is like letters, punctuation marks, and
      characters. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Form:-</b> <br />
      It organizes the raw material (substance) into meaningful units. <br />
      It's how we arrange sounds or symbols to create words, sentences, and
      ultimately convey ideas. <br />
      Form includes things like grammar rules, syntax (sentence structure), and
      morphology (word formation). <br />
    </p>

    <h1>13. Linguistic Sign and Symbol</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Linguistic Sign:- </b> <br />

      Introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, <br />
      A linguistic sign is the fundamental unit of meaning in language. <br />
      It consists of two crucial elements: <br />
      Signifier: The physical form, either spoken (sound) or written (symbol),
      that represents something. (e.g., the word "cat" spoken or written) <br />
      Signified: The mental concept or meaning that the signifier refers to.
      <br />
      The relationship between signifier and signified is arbitrary, (meaning
      there's no inherent connection). <br />
      <br />

      <b> Symbol:-</b> <br />
      A symbol is a broader concept that encompass linguistic signs, but also
      extend beyond them. <br />
      The relationship between the symbol and what it represents can be:
      Arbitrary: eg. peace sign or mathematical symbol. <br />
      Symbols can be visual, auditory, or even tactile, not limited to the
      spoken or written forms of language.
