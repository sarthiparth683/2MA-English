      <li><b>SUMMARY:-</b></li>
      <li>
        "The Playboy of the Western World" is a three-act play written by John Millington Synge, first performed in 1907. The play is set in a rural village in
        County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland and revolves around themes of identity, heroism, and the clash between reality and perception. Here's a summary
        of each act:
      </li>
      <li>
        The play opens in a small pub owned by Michael , who is away at a fair. His daughter, Pegeen Mike, is tending the pub. As the scene unfolds, Shawn
        Keogh, her timid fiancé, is reluctant to stay with her overnight despite her requests. A young stranger named Christy Mahon enters the pub, looking
        disheveled and frightened. He claims to have killed his father with a loy (a type of spade). Instead of being horrified, Pegeen and the locals are
        intrigued and impressed by his story. They consider Christy a bold and heroic figure, contrasting with the men they know. As word of Christy’s deed
        spreads, the villagers, including Widow Quin, take an interest in him, and he begins to enjoy the admiration he receives.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the second act, Christy has become a local hero. He is now confident and basking in the attention of the villagers, especially from Pegeen, who is
        increasingly charmed by him. Widow Quin, however, also takes a liking to Christy and tries to win his affections. A group of village girls arrives at
        the pub, excited to see Christy and hear his story. They bring him gifts and flirt with him, further boosting his ego. Amid this growing adoration,
        Christy prepares to compete in a local sports event, confident that he will win. However, the situation takes a dramatic turn when an unexpected visitor
        arrives: Old Mahon, Christy’s father, who is very much alive. The audience and Christy are both stunned by his arrival. Old Mahon reveals that Christy
        only gave him a minor injury during their altercation, which deflates Christy’s newfound reputation as a fearless killer.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the final act, the villagers, who once admired Christy, turn against him when they discover the truth about his father. Christy’s is shattered, and
        he desperately tries to regain the villagers’ favor. Pegeen, who was initially enchanted by Christy, feels betrayed and ashamed of her attraction to
        him. Old Mahon returns, and this time, Christy, in a moment of true courage, tries to kill his father again, but the villagers stop him. Realizing that
        Christy is not the hero they thought he was, they ridicule and reject him. In the end, Christy and his father leave the village together. As they
        depart, Christy shows signs of having matured and gained some self-awareness. Pegeen, left alone, laments the loss of the man she thought Christy was,
        uttering the play's final lines: "Oh my grief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only playboy of the western world." The play ends on a note of
        disillusionment, with the villagers returning to their mundane lives, having briefly experienced the excitement of Christy's fabricated tale.
