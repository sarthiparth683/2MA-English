      <li>
        Act 1: The play is set in a shabby boarding house in a seaside town, run
        by Meg and Petey Boles, an elderly couple. They have only one boarder,
        Stanley Webber, a reclusive and irritable pianist. Meg treats Stanley
        like a child, which irritates him, though they share a strange bond.
        Petey informs Meg that two men, Goldberg and McCann, will be arriving at
        the boarding house. Meg tells Stanley about these visitors, which makes
        him anxious. Goldberg and McCann arrive, and it's revealed that they are
        there for some mysterious purpose. The act ends with Meg telling Stanley
        that the two men are there to celebrate his birthday, even though he
        denies that it is his birthday.

        Act 2: This act takes place later in the same day. Goldberg and McCann
        interrogate Stanley in a bizarre and intimidating manner, accusing him
        of unspecified crimes and questioning his identity. They bombard him
        with nonsensical questions and accusations, which causes Stanley to
        become increasingly disoriented and frightened. The act culminates in a
        chaotic birthday party organized by Meg, where Stanley is forced to play
        along. At the party, Stanley tries to strangle Meg when the lights go
        out. When the lights come back on, Stanley is visibly shaken, and the
        act ends with him standing speechless, while the others sing "Happy
        Birthday" to him.

        Act 3: The next morning, Petey and Goldberg are in the living room,
        discussing the events of the previous night. Goldberg and McCann are
        preparing to take Stanley away, but Petey is concerned about Stanley's
        well-being. Stanley is brought down, disheveled and unresponsive, having
        been broken by the events of the previous night. Goldberg and McCann
        plan to take him to an unspecified "doctor" for treatment. Petey tries
        to stop them but is too weak to do anything. As they leave with Stanley,
        Petey tells him, "Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!" The play
        ends with Meg returning, oblivious to what has happened, and talking
        about the wonderful party they had.

        Themes: The play explores themes of identity, power, and the ambiguity
        of reality. The menacing presence of Goldberg and McCann and their
        inexplicable actions contribute to the sense of absurdity and the
        breakdown of order in the play. The play's dialogue is marked by
        Pinter's characteristic use of pauses, silences, and non-sequiturs,
        which add to the tension and mystery.
