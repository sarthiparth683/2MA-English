      <li><b>CHARACTERS:-</b></li>
      <li>
        1. Stanley Webber: Stanley is the central character of the play, a
        disheveled, neurotic, and paranoid man in his late 30s who has been
        staying at the boarding house for about a year. He claims to be a former
        pianist, though the truth of this is questionable. Stanley is deeply
        suspicious and reacts with hostility to the arrival of Goldberg and
        McCann, whom he perceives as a threat. Throughout the play, Stanley’s
        mental state deteriorates, especially under the psychological pressure
        exerted by the two men. By the end of the play, he is left catatonic,
        stripped of his identity and sense of self.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Petey Boles: Petey is Meg's husband and the owner of the boarding
        house. He is a calm and passive man, in contrast to Meg's more excitable
        personality. Petey works as a deckchair attendant, and his relationship
        with Meg is characterized by routine and a lack of deep emotional
        connection. Although he seems aware that something sinister is happening
        to Stanley, Petey is unable or unwilling to intervene effectively. In
        the final act, he makes a half-hearted attempt to prevent Stanley from
        being taken away, but ultimately fails.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Meg Boles: Meg, Petey's wife, is a childlike, somewhat delusional
        woman in her 60s who runs the boarding house. She dotes on Stanley,
        treating him almost like a surrogate son, despite his often rude and
        dismissive behavior toward her. Meg is obsessed with trivial matters,
        such as what she serves for breakfast, and she seems disconnected from
        the darker realities around her. Her innocence and naivety make her
        oblivious to the true nature of Goldberg and McCann, and she remains in
        a state of denial even as the play ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Lulu: Lulu is a young woman in her 20s who visits the boarding house
        frequently. She is flirtatious and initially shows interest in Stanley,
        but her interactions with him are awkward and ultimately fruitless. Lulu
        is drawn to Goldberg, finding him charming at first, but she later
        becomes another victim of his manipulations. Her character represents
        youthful naivety, and her experiences in the play leave her
        disillusioned and humiliated, particularly after an implied sexual
        encounter with Goldberg that leaves her emotionally scarred.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.Goldberg: Goldberg, often referred to simply as "Goldberg," is one of
        the two men who arrive at the boarding house with the apparent mission
        to take Stanley away. He is a well-dressed, smooth-talking man in his
        50s, with a facade of charm and authority. Beneath his pleasant
        exterior, Goldberg is manipulative and sadistic, using psychological
        tactics to break down Stanley. His speeches are filled with
        contradictions and vague allusions, contributing to the play's
        atmosphere of menace and ambiguity. Goldberg’s past is hinted at but
        never fully explained, adding to his enigmatic presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Dermot McCann: McCann is Goldberg's partner, an Irishman in his 30s,
        who is quieter and more physically intimidating than Goldberg. He often
        follows Goldberg's lead but also has a sense of underlying violence.
        McCann is tasked with carrying out the physical aspects of their
        mission, and he shows signs of internal conflict, especially when
        dealing with Stanley. However, he remains loyal to Goldberg and
        participates fully in the mental and emotional breakdown of Stanley.
        McCann’s character adds to the play's sense of threat and
        unpredictability.

      <li><b>SUMMARY:-</b></li>
      <li>
        Themes: The play explores themes of identity, power, and the ambiguity
        of reality. The menacing presence of Goldberg and McCann and their
        inexplicable actions contribute to the sense of absurdity and the
        breakdown of order in the play. The play's dialogue is marked by
        Pinter's characteristic use of pauses, silences, and non-sequiturs,
        which add to the tension and mystery.
      </li>
      <li>
        Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party is a classic example of the "comedy
        of menace" genre. The play unfolds in a secluded seaside boarding house
        where Stanley Webber, a seemingly aimless lodger, resides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1: The play is set in a shabby boarding house in a seaside town, run
        by Meg and Petey Boles, an elderly couple. They have only one boarder,
        Stanley Webber, a reclusive and irritable pianist. Meg treats Stanley
        like a child, which irritates him, though they share a strange bond.
        Petey informs Meg that two men, Goldberg and McCann, will be arriving at
        the boarding house. Meg tells Stanley about these visitors, which makes
        him anxious. Goldberg and McCann arrive, and it's revealed that they are
        there for some mysterious purpose. The act ends with Meg telling Stanley
        that the two men are there to celebrate his birthday, even though he
        denies that it is his birthday.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: This act takes place later in the same day. Goldberg and McCann
        interrogate Stanley in a bizarre and intimidating manner, accusing him
        of unspecified crimes and questioning his identity. They bombard him
        with nonsensical questions and accusations, which causes Stanley to
        become increasingly disoriented and frightened. The act culminates in a
        chaotic birthday party organized by Meg, where Stanley is forced to play
        along. At the party, Stanley tries to strangle (to kill somebody by
        squeezing his/her neck or throat with your hands, a rope, etc.) Meg when
        the lights go out. When the lights come back on, Stanley is visibly
        shaken, and the act ends with him standing speechless, while the others
        sing "Happy Birthday" to him.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: The next morning, Petey and Goldberg are in the living room,
        discussing the events of the previous night. Goldberg and McCann are
        preparing to take Stanley away, but Petey is concerned about Stanley's
        well-being. Stanley is brought down, disheveled and unresponsive, having
        been broken by the events of the previous night. Goldberg and McCann
        plan to take him to an unspecified "doctor" for treatment. Petey tries
        to stop them but is too weak to do anything. As they leave with Stanley,
        Petey tells him, "Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!" The play
        ends with Meg returning, oblivious to what has happened, and talking
        about the wonderful party they had.
