      <li>
        "Justice" by John Galsworthy is a play that explores the themes of law,
        morality, and the human condition. Here's a summary of each act:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act I The play begins in the office of James How, a solicitor. William
        Falder, a young and nervous clerk, is deeply in love with Ruth
        Honeywill, a woman trapped in an abusive marriage. Falder, driven by his
        affection for Ruth, forges a check to help her escape from her husband.
        He is caught by his employers, Mr. James and Mr. Walter How, who are
        initially sympathetic but eventually decide to hand him over to the
        police. The act ends with Falder’s arrest, setting the stage for the
        legal battle that follows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II This act takes place in the courtroom, where Falder is on trial
        for forgery. The defense, led by the lawyer Frome, argues that Falder's
        actions were driven by desperation and love, not criminal intent. The
        prosecution, however, is relentless in its pursuit of justice according
        to the letter of the law. The judge, though sympathetic to Falder’s
        situation, is bound by the law and finds him guilty. Falder is sentenced
        to three years of penal servitude, despite the plea for leniency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III The third act is set in the prison where Falder is serving his
        sentence. It focuses on the harsh realities of prison life and its
        dehumanizing effects on inmates. Falder is depicted as a broken man,
        crushed by the system that offers no room for rehabilitation or mercy.
        The act illustrates the brutal and unyielding nature of the justice
        system, which prioritizes punishment over understanding or reform.
        Falder’s mental and physical state deteriorates as he struggles to cope
        with the conditions in prison.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV The final act returns to the office of James How. Falder, having
        been released on probation, seeks to start afresh, but he is haunted by
        his criminal record and the stigma attached to it. He faces
        insurmountable challenges in finding employment and reintegrating into
        society. Ruth, who is still devoted to him, offers her support, but
        Falder’s spirit is too broken. The act ends tragically with Falder's
        suicide, highlighting the play's critique of a justice system that fails
        to account for the complexities of human behavior and the need for
        compassion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall Themes: "Justice" is a powerful commentary on the rigidness of
        the legal system and its failure to consider the moral and emotional
        aspects of human actions. It also explores the social consequences of
        crime and punishment, suggesting that the system, as it stands, can
        destroy individuals rather than rehabilitate them. The play calls for a
        more humane approach to justice, one that takes into account the
        circumstances and motivations behind actions, rather than simply
        adhering to the strict letter of the law.
