      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>Summary of John Galsworthy's Play "Justice" (1910)</li>
      <li>
        Act I: The play opens in the office of a solicitor, where a young clerk
        named William Falder is accused of altering a check. Falder is in love
        with Ruth Honeywill, a married woman in an abusive relationship, and he
        altered the check to help her escape her husband. The lawyer, Mr. James
        How, discovers the forgery and decides to press charges. Falder is
        arrested, despite his emotional plea and his good character.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II: The second act takes place in the courtroom. Falder’s trial
        begins, and the defense attorney, Harold Cleaver, tries to convince the
        jury that Falder’s crime was committed out of desperation to help Ruth.
        The prosecution, however, emphasizes that altering the check is a
        serious offense. Ruth's testimony highlights her predicament, but the
        jury is unsympathetic. Falder is found guilty and sentenced to three
        years of penal servitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III: The third act takes place in prison. Falder struggles with the
        harsh conditions of his imprisonment. He feels a sense of despair as the
        monotonous routine of prison life takes a toll on his mental health. The
        prison system is portrayed as dehumanizing, with no consideration for
        the personal circumstances that led to his crime. Falder’s sense of
        isolation and despair grows, and he becomes a victim of the rigid and
        unyielding nature of the justice system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV: The final act sees Falder’s release from prison. However, his
        life has been irreparably damaged. He finds it difficult to get a job
        due to his criminal record, and society refuses to accept him. Ruth, who
        had initially promised to stay by his side, is unable to provide
        support. In the end, overwhelmed by his circumstances and unable to
        reintegrate into society, Falder takes his own life. The play ends on a
        somber note, critiquing the harshness of the justice system and its
        failure to recognize the humanity of those it punishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Galsworthy’s play is a powerful critique of the legal and penal systems
        of the time, emphasizing the need for reform and compassion for those
        trapped in desperate circumstances.
