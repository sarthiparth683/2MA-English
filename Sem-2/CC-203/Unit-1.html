    <ul>
      <li>Characters:-</li>

      <li>
        1. Robert Cokeson: Cokeson is the senior clerk in the law office where
        much of the play takes place. He is depicted as a kind-hearted, loyal,
        and morally conservative man, who believes in duty, the law, and
        authority. Although well-meaning, his sense of justice is limited by his
        adherence to traditional values, which blinds him to the emotional or
        moral struggles of others. He tries to help Falder but is constrained by
        his loyalty to the firm and the legal system.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. James How: James How is one of the partners in the law firm where
        Falder works. He is strict, pragmatic, and upholds the rules of the law
        without much regard for the emotional consequences. He represents the
        cold, detached side of the legal system, prioritizing professional
        reputation over personal empathy or compassion.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Walter How: Walter How is James How's son and a junior partner in the
        firm. He is more progressive and sympathetic compared to his father,
        showing concern for Falder’s situation. Walter offers a contrast to
        James’s rigid legalism, indicating a newer generation with a more
        humanitarian approach to justice and morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Ruth Honeywill: Ruth is the female protagonist of the play. She is a
        married woman in an abusive relationship with her husband. Her
        involvement with Falder stems from her desire to escape her oppressive
        marriage. Ruth’s plight represents the societal constraints on women at
        the time, and she is portrayed with sensitivity and strength, trying to
        navigate her circumstances in a harsh world.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Falder: Falder is the tragic hero of the play. He is a young clerk
        working in the law firm and becomes entangled in a moral and legal
        dilemma when he commits forgery to help Ruth escape her abusive husband.
        Falder’s actions are driven by compassion and desperation rather than
        criminal intent. His ultimate downfall and imprisonment are a critique
        of a rigid legal system that punishes individuals without considering
        their personal circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Hector Frome: Hector Frome is Falder’s defense attorney. He is
        portrayed as a compassionate and dedicated lawyer who tries to argue for
        leniency in Falder’s case. Frome’s approach reflects a belief in
        reforming the law to accommodate mercy and understanding, contrasting
        with the harsh and inflexible judicial system of the time.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Cleaver: Cleaver is the prosecuting lawyer in the trial against
        Falder. He is stern, professional, and primarily concerned with
        enforcing the letter of the law. He represents the impersonal nature of
        legal prosecution, focusing on Falder’s crime without regard to the
        broader context or human factors that contributed to it. These
        characters collectively explore themes of justice, morality, and the
        shortcomings of the legal system. Galsworthy uses their contrasting
        perspectives to critique societal and legal norms.

      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>Summary of John Galsworthy's Play "Justice" (1910)</li>
      <li>
        Act I: The play opens in the office of a solicitor, where a young clerk
        named William Falder is accused of altering a check. Falder is in love
        with Ruth Honeywill, a married woman in an abusive relationship, and he
        altered the check to help her escape her husband. The lawyer, Mr. James
        How, discovers the forgery and decides to press charges. Falder is
        arrested, despite his emotional plea and his good character.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II: The second act takes place in the courtroom. Falder’s trial
        begins, and the defense attorney, Harold Cleaver, tries to convince the
        jury that Falder’s crime was committed out of desperation to help Ruth.
        The prosecution, however, emphasizes that altering the check is a
        serious offense. Ruth's testimony highlights her predicament, but the
        jury is unsympathetic. Falder is found guilty and sentenced to three
        years of penal servitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III: The third act takes place in prison. Falder struggles with the
        harsh conditions of his imprisonment. He feels a sense of despair as the
        monotonous routine of prison life takes a toll on his mental health. The
        prison system is portrayed as dehumanizing, with no consideration for
        the personal circumstances that led to his crime. Falder’s sense of
        isolation and despair grows, and he becomes a victim of the rigid and
        unyielding nature of the justice system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV: The final act sees Falder’s release from prison. However, his
        life has been irreparably damaged. He finds it difficult to get a job
        due to his criminal record, and society refuses to accept him. Ruth, who
        had initially promised to stay by his side, is unable to provide
        support. In the end, overwhelmed by his circumstances and unable to
        reintegrate into society, Falder takes his own life. The play ends on a
        somber note, critiquing the harshness of the justice system and its
        failure to recognize the humanity of those it punishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Galsworthy’s play is a powerful critique of the legal and penal systems
        of the time, emphasizing the need for reform and compassion for those
        trapped in desperate circumstances.
