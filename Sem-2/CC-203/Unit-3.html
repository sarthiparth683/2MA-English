      <ul>
        "Murder in the Cathedral" by T.S. Eliot is a play written in verse that
        dramatizes the assassination of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury
        Cathedral in 1170. The play is structured in two acts, with an interlude
        between them. Here's an act-wise summary:
      </ul>
      <li>
        Act I: Setting & Background: The play begins in December 1170, in the
        Archbishop's Hall at Canterbury Cathedral. The Chorus, consisting of
        women of Canterbury, introduces the atmosphere of unease and foreboding.
        They express their fear of an impending disaster and reflect on the
        Archbishop's absence from England for seven years. Thomas Becket's
        Return: Becket returns from exile in France, having had a conflict with
        King Henry II over the rights and privileges of the Church. Upon his
        return, four Tempters approach him, each offering different paths to
        avoid conflict with the King and preserve his life: First Tempter:
        Offers physical safety and the pleasures of life. Second Tempter:
        Suggests political power by joining forces with the King. Third Tempter:
        Proposes a rebellion against the King in alliance with the barons.
        Fourth Tempter: Appeals to Becket's spiritual pride, suggesting he seek
        martyrdom for personal glory. Becket's Response: Becket rejects all the
        temptations, especially the fourth one, recognizing that seeking
        martyrdom for his own glory would be a sin. He decides to follow the
        path of righteousness, accepting whatever fate God has in store for him.
        Interlude: Becket's Sermon: The interlude consists of a sermon delivered
        by Becket on Christmas morning. He speaks about the meaning of
        martyrdom, emphasizing that a martyr is someone who is killed for the
        sake of God and not for personal gain. He also prepares the people for
        his possible death, indicating that it may be a part of God's will.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II: Becket's Resolve: The second act begins after Christmas, with
        the Chorus again expressing their fear and sense of impending doom. Four
        knights, who serve King Henry II, arrive at the Cathedral. They accuse
        Becket of betraying the King and the country, and they demand that he
        submit to the King’s authority. The Knights' Accusation: The knights
        accuse Becket of treason and sacrilege. Becket, standing firm in his
        convictions, refuses to submit to the King's demands, asserting the
        supremacy of the Church over the state. Becket’s Martyrdom: The knights,
        enraged by Becket's defiance, murder him in the Cathedral. The Chorus
        laments the Archbishop’s death, feeling guilt for not having done more
        to prevent it but also recognizing the sanctity of his sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: The knights justify their actions to the audience, claiming
        they acted in defense of the King and the nation. However, the play ends
        with a sense of divine judgment, as the Chorus prays for God's mercy and
        for the Archbishop's soul. The play closes on a note of ambiguity,
        leaving the audience to reflect on the complex interplay of politics,
        religion, and morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes: Conflict between Church and State: The play highlights the
        tension between secular authority and spiritual power. Martyrdom and
        Sacrifice: It explores the concept of martyrdom, questioning the
        motivations and implications of seeking such a fate. Temptation and
        Moral Integrity: The tempters represent various forms of temptation, and
        Becket’s resistance to them illustrates the struggle to maintain moral
        integrity. "Murder in the Cathedral" is a powerful exploration of faith,
        power, and the human condition, written with poetic depth and dramatic
        intensity.
