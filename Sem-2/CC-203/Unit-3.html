      <li>SUMMARY:-</li> 
      <li>
        "Murder in the Cathedral" by T.S. Eliot is a verse drama that explores
        the final days of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his
        martyrdom in 1170. Here is a summary of the play, paragraph by
        paragraph:
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduction & Background: The play begins with a chorus of women from
        Canterbury, who express their fears and anxieties about the return of
        Archbishop Thomas Becket after seven years of exile. The women sense an
        impending doom and are uncertain about what Becket's return will bring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Becket’s Return: Becket arrives at Canterbury, greeted by priests who
        are both happy and anxious. They discuss the political tension between
        Becket and King Henry II, which had led to Becket's exile. Becket
        reflects on his role as a servant of God and the conflicts between
        spiritual authority and temporal power.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tempters: Becket is confronted by four tempters who represent
        various forms of power and pleasure. The first tempter offers physical
        safety and comfort if Becket reconciles with the king. The second offers
        power and influence in the state. The third suggests the possibility of
        leading a rebellion against the king. The fourth tempter, more subtly,
        tempts Becket with the idea of martyrdom for the sake of glory. Becket
        rejects all the temptations, recognizing the last one as the most
        dangerous because it disguises selfish pride as piety.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sermon: Becket delivers a Christmas sermon to the congregation. He
        speaks about the nature of martyrdom and the idea that true martyrdom is
        not sought for personal glory but is a submission to the will of God. He
        reflects on the mystery of Christ’s birth and the inevitability of his
        own death.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Knights: Four knights arrive, representing King Henry II. They
        accuse Becket of betrayal and treason against the crown. Becket,
        unwavering in his stance, refuses to submit to the king’s authority in
        matters of the church. The knights leave but later return to confront
        Becket in the cathedral.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Martyrdom: The chorus again expresses their fears and laments the
        fate of their archbishop. The knights return and murder Becket in the
        cathedral. After the murder, the knights justify their actions to the
        audience, claiming they acted out of duty to the king and the state, not
        out of personal malice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion & Reflection: The play concludes with the chorus reflecting
        on the significance of Becket's martyrdom. They recognize the event as
        both a tragedy and a divine act, acknowledging that Becket's sacrifice
        has a profound impact on the spiritual life of the community and the
        church.
      </li>
      <li>
        The play explores deep themes such as the conflict between church and
        state, the nature of power and authority, and the meaning of martyrdom.
        Eliot uses poetic language and the chorus to emphasize the spiritual and
        existential questions that the play raises.
