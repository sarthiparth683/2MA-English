      <li><b>CHARACTERS:-</b></li>
      <li>
        1. Thomas Becket Role: Archbishop of Canterbury, the protagonist.
        Characteristics: A man of deep spiritual conviction and faith. Initially
        conflicted but eventually embraces martyrdom for the sake of the Church.
        His return to England after a long exile sets the stage for his eventual
        assassination. He grapples with pride and personal ambition but
        overcomes these to act as a servant of God. His martyrdom is portrayed
        as a sacrifice for higher divine justice, which ultimately triumphs over
        earthly power.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The Chorus Role: Representing the women of Canterbury.
        Characteristics: Serves as the voice of the common people, offering a
        collective perspective on the events. Reflects the fear and anxiety of
        ordinary citizens regarding Becket’s return and his impending fate. They
        are caught between their desire for peace and their dread of the
        spiritual implications of Becket's martyrdom. They undergo a
        transformation from fear of change to an understanding of the
        significance of Becket’s death.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. The Four Tempters Role: Allegorical figures who tempt Becket to stray
        from his path. Characteristics: First Tempter: Represents the temptation
        of physical comfort and pleasure. Offers Becket safety and an easy life
        if he reconciles with King Henry. Second Tempter: Represents the
        temptation of power. Suggests that Becket can regain his political
        influence by aligning with the King. Third Tempter: Represents the
        temptation of political alliances. Proposes that Becket form an alliance
        with rebellious barons against the King. Fourth Tempter: The most
        dangerous temptation, appealing to Becket’s pride. Suggests that
        martyrdom itself can be a selfish act for personal glory rather than for
        God's will.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The Four Knights Role: Agents of King Henry II, responsible for
        Becket’s assassination. Characteristics: Serve as the instruments of
        temporal power, acting on behalf of the King. After Becket’s death, they
        justify their actions directly to the audience, presenting rational,
        worldly arguments for the murder. They emphasize that they are acting in
        the interest of political stability and accuse Becket of betraying the
        King and the country.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. The Priests of Canterbury Role: Church officials serving under
        Becket. Characteristics: Loyal followers of Becket but fearful of the
        consequences of his actions. They plead with Becket to seek safety and
        avoid confrontation with the King. Represent the institutional Church,
        concerned with maintaining order and avoiding conflict. Their fear
        highlights the tension between worldly concerns and spiritual sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. King Henry II (Offstage) Role: The King of England, whose political
        conflict with Becket drives the play. Characteristics: Although he never
        appears on stage, his presence looms large as the antagonist. His desire
        for control over both the Church and the state leads to a power struggle
        with Becket. Represents secular authority and the temporal power that
        Becket challenges through his spiritual convictions. Themes Reflected by
        Characters: Martyrdom: Becket’s journey reflects the play's focus on the
        conflict between spiritual integrity and worldly power. Temptation: The
        Tempters explore different facets of human weakness, mirroring Christ’s
        temptations in the desert. Political and Religious Conflict: The Knights
        and King symbolize the tension between secular authority and the
        autonomy of the Church, a major theme in medieval politics.

      <li><b>SUMMARY:-</b></li>
      <li>
        "Murder in the Cathedral" by T.S. Eliot is a verse drama that explores
        the final days of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his
        martyrdom in 1170. Here is a summary of the play, paragraph by
        paragraph:
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduction & Background: The play begins with a chorus of women from
        Canterbury, who express their fears and anxieties about the return of
        Archbishop Thomas Becket after seven years of exile. The women sense an
        impending doom and are uncertain about what Becket's return will bring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Becket’s Return: Becket arrives at Canterbury, greeted by priests who
        are both happy and anxious. They discuss the political tension between
        Becket and King Henry II, which had led to Becket's exile. Becket
        reflects on his role as a servant of God and the conflicts between
        spiritual authority and temporal power.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tempters: Becket is confronted by four tempters who represent
        various forms of power and pleasure. <br />
        The first tempter offers physical safety and comfort if Becket
        reconciles with the king. <br />
        The second offers power and influence in the state. <br />
        The third suggests the possibility of leading a rebellion against the
        king. <br />
        The fourth tempter, more subtly, tempts Becket with the idea of
        martyrdom for the sake of glory. <br />
        Becket rejects all the temptations, recognizing the last one as the most
        dangerous because it disguises selfish pride as piety.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sermon: Becket delivers a Christmas sermon to the congregation. He
        speaks about the nature of martyrdom and the idea that true martyrdom is
        not sought for personal glory but is a submission to the will of God. He
        reflects on the mystery of Christ’s birth and the inevitability of his
        own death.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Knights: Four knights arrive, representing King Henry II. They
        accuse Becket of betrayal and treason against the crown. Becket,
        unwavering in his stance, refuses to submit to the king’s authority in
        matters of the church. The knights leave but later return to confront
        Becket in the cathedral.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Martyrdom: The chorus again expresses their fears and laments the
        fate of their archbishop. The knights return and murder Becket in the
        cathedral. After the murder, the knights justify their actions to the
        audience, claiming they acted out of duty to the king and the state, not
        out of personal malice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion & Reflection: The play concludes with the chorus reflecting
        on the significance of Becket's martyrdom. They recognize the event as
        both a tragedy and a divine act, acknowledging that Becket's sacrifice
        has a profound impact on the spiritual life of the community and the
        church.
      </li>
      <li>
        The play explores deep themes such as the conflict between church and
        state, the nature of power and authority, and the meaning of martyrdom.
        Eliot uses poetic language and the chorus to emphasize the spiritual and
        existential questions that the play raises.
