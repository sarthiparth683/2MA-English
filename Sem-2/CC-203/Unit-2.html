      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>
        "Pygmalion" by George Bernard Shaw is a play that explores themes of
        social class, identity, and transformation. Here's an act-wise summary:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act I The play opens in Covent Garden, London, where a group of people
        seek shelter from the rain. Among them are Professor Henry Higgins, a
        phonetician, and Colonel Pickering, another expert in phonetics. Higgins
        impresses the crowd by identifying everyone's place of origin based on
        their accents. They notice a poor flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, who
        speaks with a strong Cockney accent. Higgins boasts that he could teach
        her to speak like a duchess in six months. After some interaction,
        Higgins and Pickering decide to work together on the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II The next day, Eliza visits Higgins' laboratory to take him up on
        his offer to improve her speech, hoping it will help her get a job in a
        flower shop. Higgins agrees, partly out of scientific curiosity, and
        Pickering wagers the cost of the experiment. They begin a rigorous
        process of teaching Eliza to speak properly, which includes correcting
        her pronunciation, teaching her manners, and changing her appearance.
        Meanwhile, Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle, visits Higgins, hoping to
        get some money in exchange for his daughter's involvement. After some
        negotiation, he leaves with five pounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III After months of training, Higgins decides to test Eliza at his
        mother's at-home party. Eliza successfully passes herself off as a
        refined lady, fooling everyone with her new speech and manners. However,
        her conversation is somewhat limited and repetitive. Later, Higgins and
        Pickering take her to an ambassador's garden party, where she
        successfully passes as a duchess, and even fools a former pupil of
        Higgins. Despite the success, Eliza begins to feel unsure of her place
        in the world, questioning her identity now that she is neither part of
        the lower class nor truly accepted by the upper class.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV Following the successful experiment, Higgins and Pickering
        celebrate their achievement, seemingly oblivious to Elizaâ€™s feelings.
        Eliza feels dehumanized and treated like an object. A confrontation
        ensues between Eliza and Higgins, where she throws his slippers at him
        in anger. She tells Higgins that she plans to leave and marry Freddy
        Eynsford-Hill, a young man from an earlier act who has fallen in love
        with her. Higgins tries to dismiss her concerns, but Eliza is determined
        to assert her independence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act V The final act is set at Mrs. Higgins' house. Eliza arrives there,
        and Alfred Doolittle, now unexpectedly wealthy due to an inheritance,
        also arrives. He bemoans his new responsibilities but is on his way to
        marry his long-time partner. Higgins arrives and tries to convince Eliza
        to return to his house, but she refuses. They argue about her future,
        and while it is clear that Higgins cares for Eliza in his way, he cannot
        express it. Eliza asserts her independence and leaves with Freddy. The
        play ends ambiguously, leaving it unclear whether Eliza will return to
        Higgins or choose a life with Freddy.
