      <li><b>Characters:-</b></li>
      <li>
        Eliza Doolittle Role: The protagonist, a poor flower girl with a strong
        Cockney accent. Characteristics: Eliza is ambitious and eager to improve
        her station in life. She is tough, independent, and determined but
        vulnerable due to her social position. Her transformation from a common
        street vendor to a lady capable of speaking "proper" English symbolizes
        the central theme of social mobility and identity in the play.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professor Henry Higgins Role: A professor of phonetics and the play's
        other main protagonist. Characteristics: Higgins is a brilliant but
        arrogant and socially indifferent man. He is passionate about phonetics
        and sees people more as subjects for his experiments rather than as
        human beings. His cold and emotionally distant nature contrasts with his
        keen intellect, and though he helps transform Eliza's life, he often
        disregards her feelings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Colonel Pickering Role: A retired officer and expert in phonetics,
        Higgins' friend and colleague. Characteristics: Pickering is kind,
        courteous, and gentlemanly, providing a foil to Higgins' brusque and
        sometimes thoughtless behavior. His respectful treatment of Eliza helps
        her gain confidence and is a key part of her transformation. He
        represents the moral and humanistic side of the phonetics experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alfred Doolittle Role: Eliza's father, a dustman (garbage collector).
        Characteristics: Doolittle is a cheerful, opportunistic, and
        philosophically cynical man. He has no desire for middle-class morality
        or responsibility but unexpectedly inherits a fortune that thrusts him
        into the very world he wanted to avoid. His speeches often satirize
        societal hypocrisy and the nature of class and morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mrs. Higgins Role: Henry Higgins' mother. Characteristics: Mrs. Higgins
        is wise, poised, and has a strong moral compass. She disapproves of her
        son's callousness and lack of social graces, often acting as a voice of
        reason. She has a better understanding of Eliza's emotional journey and
        shows genuine concern for her well-being.
      </li>
      <li>
        Freddy Eynsford-Hill Role: A young man from an impoverished aristocratic
        family, smitten with Eliza. Characteristics: Freddy is charming,
        idealistic, and somewhat naive. Though he comes from a higher class than
        Eliza, his family has lost their wealth. He falls in love with Eliza and
        contrasts with Higgins in his gentle, romantic pursuit of her.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mrs. Eynsford-Hill Role: Freddy's mother. Characteristics: Mrs.
        Eynsford-Hill is a well-meaning but financially struggling woman. She
        clings to the pretense of gentility, despite her family's declining
        circumstances. She represents the middle class, which is under strain
        during the societal changes of the time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mrs. Pearce Role: Higgins' housekeeper. Characteristics: Mrs. Pearce is
        practical, no-nonsense, and motherly. She plays a significant role in
        managing Higgins' household and often warns him about treating Eliza
        poorly. She serves as a voice of morality, showing concern for Eliza’s
        future and well-being.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ezra Wannafeller (not a major character in the play but often mentioned
        in modern references) Role: A fictional character alluded to in some
        adaptations as a wealthy philanthropist. Characteristics: Typically
        depicted as a wealthy industrialist, his name is a parody of American
        magnates like Rockefeller. He is used to represent the influence of
        wealth and charity in transforming people’s lives, though sometimes with
        unintended consequences.
      </li>
      <li><b>SUMMARY:-</b></li>
      <li>
        "Pygmalion" by George Bernard Shaw is a play that explores themes of
        social class, identity, and transformation. Here's an act-wise summary:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act I The play opens in Covent Garden, London, where a group of people
        seek shelter from the rain. Among them are Professor Henry Higgins, a
        phonetician, and Colonel Pickering, another expert in phonetics. Higgins
        impresses the crowd by identifying everyone's place of origin based on
        their accents. They notice a poor flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, who
        speaks with a strong Cockney accent. Higgins boasts that he could teach
        her to speak like a duchess in six months. After some interaction,
        Higgins and Pickering decide to work together on the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II The next day, Eliza visits Higgins' laboratory to take him up on
        his offer to improve her speech, hoping it will help her get a job in a
        flower shop. Higgins agrees, partly out of scientific curiosity, and
        Pickering wagers the cost of the experiment. They begin a rigorous
        process of teaching Eliza to speak properly, which includes correcting
        her pronunciation, teaching her manners, and changing her appearance.
        Meanwhile, Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle, visits Higgins, hoping to
        get some money in exchange for his daughter's involvement. After some
        negotiation, he leaves with five pounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III After months of training, Higgins decides to test Eliza at his
        mother's at-home party. Eliza successfully passes herself off as a
        refined lady, fooling everyone with her new speech and manners. However,
        her conversation is somewhat limited and repetitive. Later, Higgins and
        Pickering take her to an ambassador's garden party, where she
        successfully passes as a duchess, and even fools a former pupil of
        Higgins. Despite the success, Eliza begins to feel unsure of her place
        in the world, questioning her identity now that she is neither part of
        the lower class nor truly accepted by the upper class.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV Following the successful experiment, Higgins and Pickering
        celebrate their achievement, seemingly oblivious to Eliza’s feelings.
        Eliza feels dehumanized and treated like an object. A confrontation
        ensues between Eliza and Higgins, where she throws his slippers at him
        in anger. She tells Higgins that she plans to leave and marry Freddy
        Eynsford-Hill, a young man from an earlier act who has fallen in love
        with her. Higgins tries to dismiss her concerns, but Eliza is determined
        to assert her independence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act V The final act is set at Mrs. Higgins' house. Eliza arrives there,
        and Alfred Doolittle, now unexpectedly wealthy due to an inheritance,
        also arrives. He bemoans his new responsibilities but is on his way to
        marry his long-time partner. Higgins arrives and tries to convince Eliza
        to return to his house, but she refuses. They argue about her future,
        and while it is clear that Higgins cares for Eliza in his way, he cannot
        express it. Eliza asserts her independence and leaves with Freddy. The
        play ends ambiguously, leaving it unclear whether Eliza will return to
        Higgins or choose a life with Freddy.
