        Tristram Shandy is a nine-volume novel published between 1759 and 1767
        by English novelist Laurence Sterne. The full title of the novel is The
        Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. This novel is basically
        a biography of a fictional character 'Tristram Shandy'. This novel
        contains many digressions which means the narrator of the novel often
        diverts from the main story and starts talking about something else.
      </li>

      <li>
        Vol - 1 Tristram Shandy, the narrator of the novel decides to tell his
        life story from the very beginning, starting with the moment of
        Tristram's mother and father having sex and conceiving him. Tristram
        argues that the thoughts and feelings of the parents while having Sex to
        conceive a baby have a huge impact on the personality and fortunes of
        future child. In Tristram's case, his mother interrupted her husband
        while having Sex and this scattered and dispersed the sperm cells of
        Tristram's father which he believes could help in the growth and
        development of Tristram in the womb. In vol - 1 Tristram also introduces
        other character of the novel like his family, his father Walter Shandy,
        his mother Elizabeth Shandy, his uncle Toby Shandy, his house servants
        Susannah and Obadiah, his family doctor Dr.Slop and his elder brother
        Boby Shandy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 2 Second volume explores a more detailed story of Uncle Toby,
        describing his war record and the wound in his groin area. The narration
        also flashes back to the day of Tristram's birth, when his father and
        uncle Toby were chatting in the living room. Finally, Susannah came to
        inform them, that Mrs. Shandy is about to deliver the child, Susannah
        calls the midwife, she arrives but for extra precaution Walter send
        Obadiah to call Dr. Slop. Dr. Slop came but the he did not bring his
        medicine bag, then Obadiah brings the bag as Walter asks him to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 3 Before Dr. Slop can go upstairs and deliver the baby, he must
        open his doctor's bag, which has been bound up in complicated knots.
        Attempting to cut the knots with a knife, he cuts his thumb. After that,
        Susannah, the maidservant, runs downstairs to report Dr. Slop that
        things are not going well upstairs. Dr. Slop agrees to come up and
        assist, once he has tested out his forceps and his delivery technique on
        Uncle Toby's hands. While doing this, he cuts Toby's hand. After that,
        the doctor goes up to the bedchamber and while delivering the baby, Dr.
        Slop breaks Tristram’s nose and then he makes a new artificial nose.

      <li>
        Vol - 4 The 4th volume opens with "Slawkenbergius's Tale", a fictional
        character with a long nose. After this digression, the scene returns to
        Sandy's house where Walter was thinking the name of his newly born
        child. After that Susannah came to him and tell that the child may not
        survive and he needs to be baptized. Walter tells her that the child's
        name is 'Trismegistus', but Susannah forgets the name while going to the
        priest named Yorick and there she pronounced the name incorrectly as
        'Tristram'. Later Walter asks church lawyer that if he can rename the
        child but the lawyer denied, and then they have to keep the name. Walter
        Shandy wants to give money to his elder son 'Boby' for his Europe
        tripbut then he receives news that Bobby is dead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 5 Walter was very sad by Bobby’s death but then he became very
        conscious about Tristram’s education and he started writing
        Tristram-paedia in which he stated, how to teach his young child.
        Fast-forwarding to age five, Tristram describes a mishap in which he is
        circumcised (to cut off the skin of a man’s sexual organ) by a sliding
        window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 6 In Vol - 6, Walter is concerned about Tristram’s education and
        he is looking for a tutor. He asks Toby, and Toby suggested Billy Le
        Fever, son of Lieutenant Le Fever. After that the narrator once again
        diverts from the main story and started telling about the death of
        Lieutenant Le Fever and the Vol - 6 ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 7 In the Vol - 7, Tristram is now in his 40s and his is preparing
        to travel to France in order to improve his health. Tristram travels to
        the different cities of France and he feels safe there. He did not talk
        much about his trip but only tell the reader how he feels there and also
        about his dance with a village girl, Nanette.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 8 Vol - 8 explores the love story of Uncle Toby and the Widow
        Wadman. The two first met when Toby moved up from London and shifted to
        Wadman's colony where he stayed in her guest room until his own house
        could be furnished. Mrs. Wadman always tried to flirt with Toby. Mrs.
        Wadman makes a advance upon Toby by pretending to have something in her
        eye and asking him to take a look. Struck by her beauty, he realizes he
        is in love with Mrs. Wadman and he decided to propose her.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vol - 9 Toby goes to Mrs Wadman's house along with his servant Corporal
        Trim to propose her but he is scared about Wadman's reaction, then he
        summons his courage and walks to her house. Toby awkwardly confesses his
        love and proposes Mrs. Wadman for marriage. Mrs. Wadman, however, is
        mainly concerned about Toby's war wound, which she fears has left him
        impotent. Although Mrs. Wadman is already married but her husband could
        not satisfy her sexually and she is looking for a man who can satisfy
        her. After that Toby become upset when he come to know that she is
        marrying him just to fulfill her sexual desire and not because of love.
        Then, he goes to Shandy's house where Walter and Mrs. Shandy are
        chatting with Yorick and Dr. Slop and the novel closes with a lots of
        digressions and absurdity.
