      <li><b> Characters:- </b></li>

      <li>
        1. Tristram Shandy (Narrator/Protagonist) , Tristram is both the narrator and the protagonist of the novel, though ironically, his actual birth and life
        are covered only sporadically in the story. Instead, the novel is more about his thoughts, his family, and various digressions. Tristram is highly
        self-aware, witty, and prone to digressing. He represents an intellectual and reflective mind, constantly analyzing the world around him. His narration
        is famously unreliable and chaotic, jumping from one topic to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Walter Shandy (Tristram's Father) Walter is a highly intellectual but eccentric man, obsessed with philosophy and grand ideas. He is largely
        concerned with theoretical knowledge, particularly regarding childbirth, names, and the upbringing of children. Walter's intelligence is often portrayed
        as impractical. He tends to focus on abstract, far-reaching ideas, but when it comes to practical matters (such as the birth of his son Tristram), his
        plans often go awry. His character represents the folly of over-theorizing.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Elizabeth Shandy (Tristram's Mother) Elizabeth is Tristram's somewhat passive and submissive mother. She often plays a secondary role to her
        husband's grandiose ideas. Mrs. Shandy is portrayed as pragmatic, occasionally exasperated by her husband’s abstract thinking. Her famous remark during
        childbirth—asking if Walter had remembered to wind the clock—is a symbol of her concern for practical, day-to-day matters, in contrast to Walter’s
        philosophical musings.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Toby Shandy (Tristram’s Uncle) Uncle Toby is one of the central figures in the novel, and his personality and history are explored in great detail. A
        retired army captain, he is obsessed with military fortifications and battles. Toby is gentle, kind-hearted, and extremely good-natured. His obsession
        with military matters, particularly sieges, is treated with a mix of humor and affection. Despite his preoccupation with military affairs, Toby is far
        from being aggressive; in fact, he is deeply humane and pacifist at heart.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Widow Wadman is Uncle Toby’s romantic interest. She is portrayed as flirtatious and cunning, often trying to manipulate Toby into revealing whether
        his old war wound would prevent him from being a suitable husband. Her interactions with Toby are marked by humor, especially due to his obliviousness
        to her true intentions.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Corporal Trim is Uncle Toby's loyal and devoted servant. Like Toby, Trim is fascinated by military matters and frequently engages in discussions
        about fortifications and warfare with his master. He is an excellent storyteller and has a warm relationship with Toby, often serving as his companion
        in his military reenactments. Trim's character adds a lot of humor and humanity to the novel.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Billy Le Fever is the son of Lieutenant Le Fever, who is taken in by Uncle Toby after his father's death. Billy is a symbol of Toby's compassion and
        humanity. He represents the ideal of selfless care and protection, as Toby steps in as a father figure to him.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Susannah is the Shandy family's maid. Susannah is known for being somewhat dim-witted but loyal. She often gets involved in misunderstandings and
        confusions that add to the novel's chaotic and humorous atmosphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. Obadiah is another servant of the Shandy household. Obadiah is portrayed as somewhat clumsy and is frequently at the center of mishaps, including his
        fumbling during Tristram’s delivery. His character adds to the comedic nature of the novel’s events.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Dr. Slop is the man-midwife hired to assist with Tristram’s birth. He is pompous, opinionated, and bumbling. Much of the humor surrounding Dr. Slop
        comes from his mishandling of situations, such as injuring Tristram’s nose during childbirth. He represents the arrogance and ineffectiveness of
        contemporary medical practitioners.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Bobby Shandy (Tristram's Older Brother) is Tristram’s elder brother, who dies young. His death plays a crucial role in Tristram's life as it makes
        Tristram the heir of the Shandy estate. His presence is felt more through his absence and the influence his death has on the family, especially Walter.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Slawkenbergius is a fictional scholar, mentioned in one of Tristram’s many digressions. He is known for his work on noses, particularly through the
        telling of an anecdote involving a man with an extraordinarily large nose. His character is part of the novel's satirical take on scholarly figures.
      </li>
      <li>
        13. Trismegistus is another figure who appears in Tristram’s digressions. His name is derived from Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary Hellenistic figure
        associated with wisdom and alchemy. In the novel, his name is used humorously as part of Tristram’s philosophical ramblings.
      </li>
      <li>
        14. Yorick is the local parson and one of the novel’s most important secondary characters. Characteristics: Yorick is witty, playful, and often
        philosophical, reflecting Sterne’s own views on life and religion. His name, borrowed from the dead court jester in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, adds a layer
        of melancholic reflection to the character. Yorick dies early in the novel, but his memory continues to influence the characters, particularly Tristram.

        father having sex and conceiving him. Tristram argues that the thoughts and feelings of the parents while having Sex to conceive a baby have a huge
        impact on the personality and fortunes of future child. In Tristram's case, his mother interrupted her husband while having Sex and this scattered and
        dispersed the sperm cells of Tristram's father which he believes could help in the growth and development of Tristram in the womb. In vol - 1 Tristram

        the child's name is 'Trismegistus', but Susannah forgets the name while going to the priest named Yorick and there she pronounced the name incorrectly
