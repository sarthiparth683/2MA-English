      <li>
        Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews is a novel, . This novel is divided into four books.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book I: The Introduction and Beginning of Joseph’s Journey Act 1
        (Chapters 1-10): Joseph Andrews is introduced as the virtuous brother of
        the famous Pamela, from Samuel Richardson's earlier novel. He works as a
        footman for Lady Booby. After resisting the sexual advances of Lady
        Booby, Joseph is dismissed from service. On his way back home to the
        countryside, he is attacked by robbers and left for dead. He is found by
        a good Samaritan, Mr. Adams, a clergyman who becomes his travel
        companion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2 (Chapters 11-18): Joseph recovers from his injuries with the help
        of a local woman, Betty, and continues his journey. Mr. Adams, who is on
        his way to London to sell sermons, decides to accompany Joseph. They
        encounter various characters, including a host of rogues and hypocrites
        who symbolize the moral corruption of society.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book II: The Journey with Parson Adams Act 3 (Chapters 1-10): Parson
        Adams and Joseph face a series of misadventures, meeting people who
        represent the greed, selfishness, and vanity of society. Adams is
        portrayed as a good-natured, naïve, and absent-minded man who often
        fails to see the evil in others. At an inn, Adams and Joseph are tricked
        by dishonest innkeepers and travelers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4 (Chapters 11-17): The duo faces more comic mishaps. At one point,
        Parson Adams mistakenly leaves his sermons behind, which leads to more
        humorous situations. Through these incidents, Fielding explores the
        contrast between Adams' sincerity and the hypocrisy of the people they
        meet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book III: Joseph’s Reunion with Fanny and Parson Adams’ Continued
        Misfortunes Act 5 (Chapters 1-10): Joseph is reunited with his love,
        Fanny Goodwill, a poor but virtuous young woman. The narrative shifts to
        focus on their relationship, as well as Parson Adams' continued naïveté.
        The group encounters Squire Booby (Lady Booby’s nephew), and Joseph and
        Fanny’s journey becomes more difficult as they are obstructed by social
        barriers and ill-intentioned characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 6 (Chapters 11-13): A series of misunderstandings and accidents
        delay Joseph and Fanny's marriage. Parson Adams, as always, provides
        comic relief with his obliviousness and idealism. At this point,
        Fielding uses satire to critique the class system and religious
        hypocrisy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book IV: Resolution of the Plot and Happy Ending Act 7 (Chapters 1-8):
        Lady Booby reappears, trying to prevent the marriage between Joseph and
        Fanny. She attempts to manipulate the situation through legal and social 
        means. Meanwhile, Parson Adams continues to support the young couple,
        even as he faces ridicule and hardship.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 8 (Chapters 9-17): The novel reaches its climax with the revelation
        that Joseph is not actually of low birth. It turns out that Joseph is
        the son of Mr. Wilson, a gentleman, making him a suitable match for
        Fanny. The novel ends on a happy note with Joseph and Fanny's marriage,
        and Fielding reaffirms the importance of virtue over wealth or social
        status.
      </li>
      <li>
        Key Themes: Virtue vs. Vice: Joseph, Fanny, and Parson Adams are
        embodiments of virtue, while most other characters represent vice,
        greed, and selfishness. Class and Society: Fielding satirizes the class
        system, showing how true virtue and goodness are not tied to social
        rank. Religion and Hypocrisy: Parson Adams represents genuine Christian
        values, in contrast to many hypocritical figures who misuse religion for
        personal gain. Joseph Andrews is a comic and satirical novel that takes
        a humorous yet insightful look at 18th-century English society.
