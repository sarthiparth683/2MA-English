      <li>Published in 1742</li>  
      <li><b> Characters:- </b></li>
      <li>
        Joseph Andrews Role: The protagonist of the novel, Joseph is a virtuous and handsome young man. He starts as a footman in Lady Booby’s service.
        Characteristics: Joseph is known for his strong moral character, chastity, and loyalty. His commitment to his beloved Fanny and his refusal to succumb
        to the advances of Lady Booby and Mrs. Slipslop demonstrate his virtue. Throughout the novel, Joseph endures many challenges but remains steadfast in
        his principles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sir Thomas Booby Role: The deceased husband of Lady Booby. Though he plays no direct role in the events of the novel, his death leads to Joseph's
        dismissal from Lady Booby’s service. Characteristics: Sir Thomas is portrayed as a wealthy but somewhat indifferent nobleman. He leaves behind a legacy
        that indirectly influences the actions of other characters, especially Lady Booby.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lady Booby Role: The widow of Sir Thomas Booby and Joseph's former employer. Characteristics: Lady Booby is depicted as vain, manipulative, and lustful.
        She becomes infatuated with Joseph and tries to seduce him, but his refusal humiliates her, leading to her attempts to ruin his life. Her character
        highlights themes of social hypocrisy and the abuse of power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abraham Adams Role: A parson and Joseph's friend and protector. Characteristics: Parson Adams is one of the most memorable characters in the novel,
        known for his good-natured simplicity, absent-mindedness, and moral integrity. He is often portrayed humorously as a man of great learning in theology
        but lacking in common sense. Despite his comic elements, Adams is deeply virtuous and serves as a father figure to Joseph.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mrs. Slipslop Role: A servant in Lady Booby’s household who also develops romantic feelings for Joseph. Characteristics: Mrs. Slipslop is depicted as
        hypocritical and conniving. She fancies herself a refined woman, but her pretensions to gentility are undercut by her crude and lascivious nature. Like
        Lady Booby, she is rejected by Joseph, which only fuels her spiteful behavior toward him.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fanny Goodwill Role: Joseph's beloved, a simple, beautiful country girl. Characteristics: Fanny is portrayed as virtuous, innocent, and loving. Her
        purity mirrors Joseph’s, and she endures many of the same hardships as him. Despite her hardships, including being kidnapped, Fanny remains true to her
        love for Joseph.
      </li>
      <li>Mr. Abraham Adams Role: Same as the character "Abraham Adams" described above, this is just another name or way of referring to Parson Adams.</li>
      <li>
        Justice of the Peace Role: A corrupt and arrogant figure of authority who tries to manipulate legal processes for personal gain. Characteristics: The
        Justice of Peace is a satirical representation of the abuse of judicial power. He epitomizes the legal corruption and hypocrisy that Fielding criticizes
        throughout the novel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two Ruffians Role: Villains who attack Joseph and Fanny on their journey. Characteristics: These characters represent the physical dangers that the
        virtuous protagonists face. They attempt to rob and harm Joseph, highlighting the theme of vulnerability of the lower classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Betty Role: A servant at an inn who has romantic designs on Joseph. Characteristics: Betty is depicted as another woman attracted to Joseph's physical
        beauty. Like Mrs. Slipslop, she tries to seduce Joseph but fails. Her character adds to the comic elements of the novel as well as the recurring theme
        of chastity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trulliber Role: A greedy, hypocritical parson who contrasts sharply with Parson Adams. Characteristics: Trulliber is depicted as a gluttonous,
        self-serving cleric who lacks Adams' genuine Christian virtue. He symbolizes the moral decay of certain members of the clergy and is presented in a
        negative light, particularly in contrast to Adams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peddler Role: A minor but pivotal character who reveals crucial information about Joseph and Fanny’s parentage. Characteristics: The peddler is
        practical, wise, and well-informed. He plays a critical role in the resolution of the novel by discovering and revealing the true identity of Joseph and
        Fanny, leading to the discovery that they are not siblings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mr. and Mrs. Willson Role: The biological parents of Joseph Andrews. Characteristics: They are revealed at the end of the novel to be Joseph’s true
        parents. Their story is one of regret and loss, as they were separated from their son at birth, but their reunion with Joseph provides a happy ending to
        the novel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hunter of Men Role: The figure responsible for the attempted kidnapping of Fanny. Characteristics: He is a violent and dangerous man who represents the
        physical threats to Fanny’s safety. His character serves to increase the stakes of the narrative and adds to the adventures that Joseph and Fanny face.
      </li>
      <li>
        Servants of Lady Booby Role: They assist Joseph, Fanny, and Adams in various parts of the novel, often working against Lady Booby's wishes.
        Characteristics: They are generally depicted as loyal and helpful, in contrast to their mistress's devious nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mr. Booby and Pamela Role: Mr. Booby is Lady Booby’s nephew, and Pamela, his wife, is the title character of Fielding’s earlier parody Shamela (a satire
        on Richardson’s Pamela). Characteristics: Pamela is presented as virtuous and modest, though her story was originally satirized by Fielding. She now
        appears as a more sympathetic character, lending her support to Joseph and Fanny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Didapper Role: A foppish young man hired by Lady Booby to seduce Fanny in an attempt to thwart her relationship with Joseph. Characteristics: Didapper
        is shallow, foolish, and easily manipulated. His failure to seduce Fanny provides comic relief and further demonstrates the strength of her and Joseph's
        love.

        Key Themes: Virtue vs. Vice: Joseph, Fanny, and Parson Adams are embodiments of virtue, while most other characters represent vice, greed, and
        selfishness. Class and Society: Fielding satirizes the class system, showing how true virtue and goodness are not tied to social rank. Religion and
        Hypocrisy: Parson Adams represents genuine Christian values, in contrast to many hypocritical figures who misuse religion for personal gain. Joseph
        Andrews is a comic and satirical novel that takes a humorous yet insightful look at 18th-century English society.
