      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>
        "Moll Flanders" by Daniel Defoe is a novel rather than a play, so it
        doesn't have acts like a traditional play would. Instead, the book is
        structured as a continuous narrative, following the life of the
        protagonist, Moll Flanders, from her birth to old age. However, I can
        provide a summary of the novel by dividing it into key sections or
        "acts" to give you a sense of the major events in her life:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1: Early Life and First Marriage Background: Moll Flanders is born
        in Newgate Prison, London, to a convicted felon. She is raised by a
        foster mother who teaches her how to be a domestic servant. First
        Romance: As a teenager, Moll is courted by two brothers in the household
        where she serves. She is seduced by the elder brother, who then arranges
        for her to marry his younger brother. Moll marries the younger brother
        but soon becomes a widow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: Marriages and Downfall Second Marriage: Moll marries a prosperous
        draper, but he quickly squanders their money and flees to France to
        avoid debt, leaving Moll to fend for herself. Third Marriage: Moll
        marries again, this time to a wealthy plantation owner from Virginia.
        They live happily for some time, but when they return to England, she
        discovers that he is actually her half-brother. Horrified, they
        separate. Fourth Marriage: Moll marries a banker, who eventually dies,
        leaving her with a small inheritance. She loses most of it through bad
        investments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Life of Crime Descent into Crime: Penniless and desperate, Moll
        turns to a life of crime. She becomes a skilled thief, pickpocket, and
        con artist, using her beauty and cunning to deceive men and steal from
        them. Capture and Imprisonment: Moll's criminal activities eventually
        catch up with her, and she is arrested. She is sentenced to death but
        manages to get her sentence commuted to transportation to the American
        colonies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: Redemption and Final Years Transportation to Virginia: Moll is
        transported to Virginia, where she is reunited with her son (from her
        marriage to her half-brother) and her previous husband, who has also
        been transported for his crimes. Repentance and Prosperity: Moll repents
        for her life of crime and, with her husband, lives a prosperous life in
        the colonies, growing old peacefully.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: The novel ends with Moll and her husband returning to
        England after many years, wealthy and repentant, where Moll resolves to
        live the rest of her life in penitence. This structure highlights the
        rise, fall, and eventual redemption of Moll Flanders, portraying her as
        a complex character who navigates a challenging and often morally
        ambiguous life.
