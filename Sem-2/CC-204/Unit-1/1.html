        Moll Flanders (Protagonist) Role: Moll is the central character and
        narrator of the novel. Born in Newgate Prison to a convicted mother, she
        goes through a life filled with marriages, crime, and misfortune. Her
        primary goal is survival and securing wealth, often through morally
        questionable means such as theft, manipulation, and deceit. She
        represents a strong, cunning, and resilient woman who constantly adapts
        to her circumstances. Characteristics: Moll is pragmatic, opportunistic,
        and resourceful. Her desires for upward mobility and financial security
        drive much of her actions. Though her choices are often criminal, she
        remains a sympathetic character due to the harsh conditions she faces.
        Her morality is flexible, shaped by survival rather than ideology.
      </li>
      <li>
        Robin (First Husband) Role: Robin is Moll's first husband. He is the
        younger son of a wealthy family who falls in love with Moll despite his
        family’s disapproval. After their marriage, Moll lives a relatively
        happy life until Robin dies. Characteristics: Robin is portrayed as
        kind, loving, and sincere. However, his role in Moll's life is
        short-lived as he dies early, leaving Moll widowed and financially
        vulnerable.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Draper (Tradesman) (Second Husband) Role: Moll’s second husband is a
        draper or tradesman. He is a man whose business begins to fail due to
        poor financial decisions, and he ends up in debtor’s prison.
        Characteristics: He is irresponsible and financially unstable. Moll
        leaves him because of his mounting debts and eventual imprisonment,
        symbolizing her pragmatic approach to relationships, where financial
        stability is more important than love.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Plantation Owner (Third Husband) Role: Moll's third husband is a
        plantation owner in Virginia, where she discovers that he is actually
        her half-brother. Upon learning this, their marriage becomes impossible
        to continue, and Moll leaves him. Characteristics: He is a well-to-do
        and seemingly respectable man, but his role in the story becomes morally
        complex when it is revealed that he and Moll share the same mother,
        making their marriage incestuous. This situation highlights Moll's
        continued misfortune and the dark ironies of her life.
      </li>
      <li>
        James (Lancashire Husband) (Fourth Husband) Role: James is a highwayman
        who marries Moll, believing she is wealthy, just as Moll marries him
        under the assumption he has money. When they both discover the truth,
        they amicably part ways. Characteristics: James is charming,
        adventurous, and roguish. Like Moll, he is motivated by financial gain,
        making them kindred spirits in a way. Despite their separation, they
        have a mutual respect for one another, and later they reunite.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Banker (Clerk) (Fifth Husband) Role: Moll’s fifth and final husband
        is a banker’s clerk. He helps her after her failed marriages and
        criminal activities, and he turns out to be a decent and loyal partner,
        despite Moll’s past. Characteristics: He is compassionate, patient, and
        forgiving, offering Moll the stability she had sought throughout her
        life. Their relationship represents a turning point where Moll’s
        turbulent life begins to settle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Newgate Prison (Setting and Symbol) Role: Newgate Prison in London plays
        a crucial role in Moll’s life as both the place of her birth and where
        she is imprisoned later in life for her crimes. It is a symbol of the
        cycles of crime, punishment, and redemption that shape Moll’s story.
        Characteristics: As a place, Newgate is harsh and brutal, reflecting the
        grim realities of the legal system and the consequences of a life of
        crime in Moll’s world.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Gypsies Role: Early in Moll’s life, she is raised by a group of
        Gypsies after being abandoned. They are part of her early experiences
        with poverty and survival. Characteristics: They represent Moll's
        initial exposure to a life of hardship and the lower rungs of society.
        They instill in her the mindset that would later fuel her self-reliance
        and opportunism.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Nurse Role: A caretaker who takes care of Moll as a child and is one
        of the few people in her early life who shows her kindness.
        Characteristics: The nurse is nurturing and serves as a mother figure to
        young Moll before Moll is left to fend for herself. She represents the
        fleeting presence of warmth in Moll’s difficult early years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elder Son Role: Moll has children from her various marriages, including
        an elder son from her union with the plantation owner (her
        half-brother). The relationship is distant due to Moll leaving him in
        Virginia. Characteristics: He is mostly a figure in Moll’s past, a part
        of the life she left behind when her marriage to the plantation owner
        fell apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Younger Son Role: Another son of Moll, though little is said about him.
        Moll’s children often serve as reminders of her various marriages and
        the consequences of her actions. Characteristics: Like her elder son, he
        is largely absent from Moll’s later life, signifying her transitory
        relationships and lack of deep familial connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Humphrey Role: Humphrey is the son Moll has with her third husband, the
        plantation owner (and her half-brother). He remains with his father when
        Moll leaves Virginia. Characteristics: Humphrey is a minor character,
        more important as a symbol of Moll’s separation from her family and the
        dark moral complexities of her life.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Gentleman of Bath Role: This character is one of Moll’s lovers, with
        whom she has a long-term affair while living in Bath. Their relationship
        is based on mutual pleasure and financial gain. Characteristics: The
        Gentleman of Bath is wealthy, charming, and indulgent. He provides Moll
        with a comfortable lifestyle for a time, but their relationship lacks
        deep emotional connection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jamy Role: Jamy is one of Moll’s children, mentioned briefly in the
        novel. Like her other children, he is a reminder of the consequences of
        Moll’s transient relationships. Characteristics: Jamy’s role is minor,
        but his existence contributes to the recurring theme of Moll’s
        fragmented family life.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Bank Clerk Role: This character is involved in one of Moll’s many
        financial dealings, possibly connected to her fifth husband. He
        represents the financial networks Moll navigates throughout her life.
        Characteristics: The bank clerk is a symbol of Moll’s interactions with
        the financial world, where she often resorts to manipulation and crime
        to gain advantage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes Highlighted Through the Characters Survival and Morality: Moll’s
        flexible morality is a reflection of her need to survive in a harsh
        world where women had limited opportunities for advancement. Crime and
        Punishment: Many of the characters, especially Moll’s husbands and the
        people she encounters, deal with crime and its consequences. Moll
        herself is deeply entangled in criminal activities, leading to her
        eventual imprisonment in Newgate. Social Class and Wealth: Moll's
        various marriages and relationships reflect the rigid class structures
        of the time, and her constant striving for financial security
        underscores the social inequalities she faces.

      <li><b> Summary of Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe:-</b></li>
      <li>
        Early Life and Background Moll Flanders, born in Newgate Prison to a
        criminal mother, starts her life in poverty. Her mother is eventually
        transported to America, leaving Moll in the care of a foster family.
        Growing up, Moll dreams of becoming a "gentlewoman," someone who can
        live independently without working as a servant.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Romantic Relationship As a young woman, Moll becomes involved with
        the two brothers of a wealthy family. The elder brother seduces her, but
        instead of marrying her, he convinces his younger brother to do so. Moll
        marries the younger brother and has two children, but when he dies
        young, she is left widowed and poor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Marriage and Life of Crime After her first husband’s death, Moll
        quickly remarries a tradesman, but the relationship fails due to
        financial troubles. They separate, and Moll begins a new chapter of her
        life, falling into a series of relationships and crimes to survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Marriage – Incestuous Relationship Moll marries a man from
        Virginia and moves to the American colonies. They live together happily
        for a time, and she bears him children. However, Moll discovers that her
        husband is actually her half-brother, as their mother is the same.
        Horrified, she flees back to England, leaving her children behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth and Fifth Marriages Returning to England, Moll marries a banker.
        However, this marriage is short-lived as her husband dies. Moll’s next
        marriage is to a highwayman, a criminal like herself, which reflects her
        deepening involvement in theft and crime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Life as a Thief After her fifth marriage, Moll turns to a full life of
        crime. She becomes a highly successful thief and pickpocket, using her
        wit and charm to deceive and steal from others. Over time, she becomes
        infamous for her criminal activities and manages to avoid capture for
        many years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrest and Imprisonment Eventually, Moll is caught and sentenced to
        death in Newgate Prison, the same place where she was born. However, she
        is able to manipulate the legal system and receives a reprieve from
        execution. Instead, she is sentenced to transportation to the American
        colonies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Redemption and New Life in America In America, Moll is reunited with one
        of her former husbands, and together they begin a new life. Moll repents
        for her past crimes and, with her husband, becomes a successful
        landowner. They live out their days in peace and relative prosperity,
        finally escaping the cycle of crime that had defined Moll’s life. This
        novel showcases Moll’s moral ambiguity as she moves between different
        social classes, relationships, and acts of deception, but ultimately
        finds redemption.
