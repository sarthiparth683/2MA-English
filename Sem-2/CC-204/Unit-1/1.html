      <li>Summary of Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe::-</li>
      <li>
        Early Life and Background Moll Flanders, born in Newgate Prison to a
        criminal mother, starts her life in poverty. Her mother is eventually
        transported to America, leaving Moll in the care of a foster family.
        Growing up, Moll dreams of becoming a "gentlewoman," someone who can
        live independently without working as a servant.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Romantic Relationship As a young woman, Moll becomes involved with
        the two brothers of a wealthy family. The elder brother seduces her, but
        instead of marrying her, he convinces his younger brother to do so. Moll
        marries the younger brother and has two children, but when he dies
        young, she is left widowed and poor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Marriage and Life of Crime After her first husband’s death, Moll
        quickly remarries a tradesman, but the relationship fails due to
        financial troubles. They separate, and Moll begins a new chapter of her
        life, falling into a series of relationships and crimes to survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Marriage – Incestuous Relationship Moll marries a man from
        Virginia and moves to the American colonies. They live together happily
        for a time, and she bears him children. However, Moll discovers that her
        husband is actually her half-brother, as their mother is the same.
        Horrified, she flees back to England, leaving her children behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth and Fifth Marriages Returning to England, Moll marries a banker.
        However, this marriage is short-lived as her husband dies. Moll’s next
        marriage is to a highwayman, a criminal like herself, which reflects her
        deepening involvement in theft and crime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Life as a Thief After her fifth marriage, Moll turns to a full life of
        crime. She becomes a highly successful thief and pickpocket, using her
        wit and charm to deceive and steal from others. Over time, she becomes
        infamous for her criminal activities and manages to avoid capture for
        many years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrest and Imprisonment Eventually, Moll is caught and sentenced to
        death in Newgate Prison, the same place where she was born. However, she
        is able to manipulate the legal system and receives a reprieve from
        execution. Instead, she is sentenced to transportation to the American
        colonies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Redemption and New Life in America In America, Moll is reunited with one
        of her former husbands, and together they begin a new life. Moll repents
        for her past crimes and, with her husband, becomes a successful
        landowner. They live out their days in peace and relative prosperity,
        finally escaping the cycle of crime that had defined Moll’s life. This
        novel showcases Moll’s moral ambiguity as she moves between different
        social classes, relationships, and acts of deception, but ultimately
        finds redemption.
