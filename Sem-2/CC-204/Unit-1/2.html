      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa (published in 1748) is one of the longest
        novels in English literature and revolves around themes of virtue,
        morality, and the complexities of human relationships. Here's a summary
        broken down by key sections:
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarissa's Family Conflict: Clarissa Harlowe is a young woman from a
        wealthy family, admired for her beauty, intelligence, and virtue. Her
        family, however, pressures her to marry a man named Mr. Solmes, whom she
        finds repugnant. Their motive is to gain social standing and further
        wealth. Clarissa, refusing to marry for convenience, faces increasing
        hostility from her family, creating a conflict between personal
        integrity and familial duty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lovelace's Entrance: Enter Robert Lovelace, a charming but manipulative
        libertine who seeks to win Clarissa’s affection. After Clarissa refuses
        Mr. Solmes, Lovelace offers her an escape from her oppressive home
        environment. Clarissa is reluctant but eventually flees with him,
        believing that she will retain control of her situation. However,
        Lovelace has ulterior motives, and his intentions toward Clarissa are
        far from honorable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarissa's Capture and Betrayal: After their escape, Lovelace takes
        Clarissa to London under false pretenses. He continually deceives her,
        shifting between professions of love and increasingly controlling
        behavior. Despite Clarissa’s insistence on maintaining her chastity,
        Lovelace’s obsession leads him to imprison her in a brothel-like
        environment, where he eventually drugs and rapes her. This act marks the
        novel’s tragic turning point, shattering Clarissa's spirit and leading
        to her complete emotional ruin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarissa’s Decline: Following the assault, Clarissa becomes consumed by
        shame, guilt, and despair. She repeatedly refuses Lovelace’s offers of
        marriage, as she cannot forgive his betrayal. Her family, unaware of the
        full extent of Lovelace’s actions, remains estranged from her,
        compounding her isolation. Despite efforts by her friends to reconcile
        her with society, Clarissa withdraws, focusing on her moral and
        spiritual redemption.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lovelace’s Regret and Clarissa’s Death: Lovelace, after realizing the
        extent of his wrongdoing, experiences moments of regret, but his
        repentance comes too late. Clarissa, now fully alienated from her family
        and society, falls into illness. She dies with a clear conscience,
        convinced of her spiritual salvation, but the novel makes it clear that
        her death is a result of the cruelty and societal pressures inflicted
        upon her.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aftermath and Retribution: After Clarissa's death, Lovelace is filled
        with guilt and eventually meets a violent end in a duel with Colonel
        Morden, a relative of Clarissa who seeks revenge. The novel ends with a
        moral resolution, where Lovelace is punished for his sins, but not
        before the reader is left to reflect on the injustices Clarissa suffered
        at the hands of both Lovelace and her own family. Overall, Clarissa is a
        deeply moving exploration of virtue, suffering, and the consequences of
        human cruelty, raising questions about societal expectations, autonomy,
        and morality.
