      <li>
        Wuthering Heights, the only novel by Emily BrontÃ«, is a tempestuous tale
        of love, revenge, and social class set against the wild backdrop of the
        Yorkshire moors. Here's a quick breakdown: The Story: The novel centers
        on Heathcliff, a foundling with a mysterious past, who is taken in by
        Mr. Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff develops an intense bond
        with Mr. Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine. Their love is passionate but
        ultimately unequal due to social standing. Catherine, fearing poverty
        with Heathcliff, chooses to marry the wealthy Edgar Linton from
        neighboring Thrushcross Grange. This decision shatters Heathcliff, who
        disappears for years. Upon his return, a wealthy and embittered
        Heathcliff seeks revenge on those who wronged him, particularly
        Catherine and Edgar. The story unfolds through the eyes of Lockwood, a
        tenant at Thrushcross Grange, who learns the tragic history from
        housekeeper Nelly Dean. The narrative follows the next generation as
        Heathcliff manipulates the lives of Catherine's children and Hareton,
        the son of his deceased enemy.

      <li>Themes:-</li>
      <li>
        Love and Revenge: The story explores the all-consuming passion between
        Heathcliff and Catherine, and how its rejection fuels Heathcliff's
        obsessive desire for revenge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social Class: The novel critiques the rigid social hierarchy of the
        time, highlighting the constraints it places on love and opportunity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nature vs. Nurture: The wild Yorkshire moors mirror the characters'
        untamed emotions, raising questions about the influence of environment
        and upbringing.

      <li>gh the events in the novel seem to happen in a remote and isolated place and the
        with their intense emotions, particularly the Byronic Heathcliff, seem out of the
        vidently Wuthering Heights is very much situated within a historical context. Since
        the only novel of the author, early biographical studies created an image of the author
        use, a shy but intense and brooding personality. A closer look at her life makes it
        that Emily Bronte was not really cut off from the society around her and was quite
        of the changes happening around her. The changing character of industry, created new
        classes with economic interests that came in conflict with each other and broke the
        the traditional structure of society. The potential of the independent individual was
        on. The historical background prepares us for analyzing the characters as
        s caught in a changing society and their responses to it. It also allows us to evaluate

      <li>LET US SUM UP 
      </li>
      <li>We must remember, Wuthering Heights was being written in an age that lay great stress on
        meaning, sense, order, civilization and progress. Perhaps that is the reason why early critics
        of the novel arrived at single explanations of the novel. The realistic in the novel was seen a
        veneer over what was essentially romantic and spiritual in nature. But in'reality it was
        precisely all the virtues of the mid-Victorian society of meaning, sense, order, civilization and
        progress that were being subverted by Catherine-Heathcliff. To my mind, Emily Bronte was
        throwing a challenge, quite remarkable in that day and age, by creating a relationship that
        would resist being defined by the codes of her society. To begin with, Nelly and Lockwood
        fail miserably to define or codifj that relationship. The author's triumph is in her narrator's
        failure. </li>
      <li>Nelly's story to Lockwood is her version of the real thing. It is her understanding and her
        representation. Narration is representation. But like all representations it is not the real thing
        but an image of it, a copy. Nelly narrates her story both for her own benefit as well as for the
        benefit of her audience (Lockwood). Both she and Lockwood, as we have observed, are
        already positioned within certain.social structures of thought and belief, which we call
        ideology. This ideology colours their narration by which they may not only misread and
        misinterpret some of the conditions of their story but also occasionally misrepresent things.
        What it means is that ideology is part of the narrative. One of the characteristics of ideology
        is that it grabs people, mostly without their being aware of it. Nelly is the primary narrator,
        and has already been grabbed by the ideology of her times. In turn, her narrative grabs
        Lockwood. 'See, how Lockwood never questions any of Nelly's assumptions, assertions or
        qualifications. Lockwood's narration is what the author is using to grab her readers. If one is
        not careful, Lockwood waald seduce us all to accept his narrative without any questions, just
        as he did of Nelly's account of the events. It is here that the pseudonymous Ellis Bell is of
        vital importance. Nelly's impression of the events at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross
        Grange impresses Lockwood who in turn has impressed Ellis Bell who authors the story for
        publication. This brings us to a series of interesting questions. Is Emily Bronte suggesting
        that she has not been seduced by the story? Since this is not her story but Ellis Bell's? Has
        Emily Bronte succeeded in resisting the ideology of her narrators? Does Emily Bronte neither
        share Lockwood's ideas nor his kind of enthusiasm about the story?. For her the events have a
        completely different meaning that she would rather not divulge.or finds it iinpossible to
        explain? </li>
      <li>The answers to these questions are not easy, but the point I am trying to make is that'there is a
        distinction between the narratorlnarrators and thesauthor. Emily Bronte was aware of the
        dititidiiittitithidlfhthihitiitif
        deology of her own times. This is not a new technique. Chaucer used it in Thc
        &l,ry Tules, and Swift in Gulliver's Travcls and later Conrad would use similar
        niques in his novels. In all the cases a persona is used for the narrative whose intellectual
        ion was often questionable and there was always the scope of arriving at meanings other
        what the narrator was able to draw or suggest. Similarly, a sophisticated use of the same
        ique is used in Wuthering Heights. The narrative pattem is potentially radical in the way
        sts attempts of reading a singular meaning into it. To the modem reader, the narrative
        ique in Wuthering Heights helps in the emergence of plura</li>
