      <li>
        1. Emma Woodhouse Role: The protagonist of the novel, a wealthy, intelligent, and independent young woman. Characteristics: Emma is confident in her
        social standing and proud of her matchmaking skills, though often misguided in her attempts to manipulate the lives of others. She’s witty and charming,
        but her overconfidence and lack of self-awareness often lead to misjudgments, especially concerning love and relationships. Throughout the novel, she
        matures and gains self-awareness, realizing her flaws.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Mr. Woodhouse (Emma's father) Role: Emma’s overly cautious and hypochondriac father. Characteristics: Mr. Woodhouse is excessively concerned with
        health and safety, always worried about illnesses and accidents. His overly protective nature causes him to oppose any kind of change, such as
        marriages, because he believes it disturbs his peaceful life. His anxieties are often humorously exaggerated, and he is affectionate but rather
        ineffective in providing parental guidance for Emma.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Isabella Knightley (née Woodhouse) Role: Emma’s elder sister, married to John Knightley. Characteristics: Isabella shares her father’s anxious nature
        and is also very concerned with the health and well-being of her family. She’s a devoted wife and mother, living a calm, domestic life with her husband
        and children. While less prominent in the story, she represents a stable, family-centered existence, contrasting with Emma's single, adventurous life.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Miss Taylor / Mrs. Weston (Emma’s Governess) Role: Emma’s former governess and close friend who marries Mr. Weston. Characteristics: Mrs. Weston is
        gentle, kind, and has a motherly influence on Emma. She encourages Emma’s good qualities and is one of the few characters who can gently criticize her.
        Her marriage to Mr. Weston brings her happiness, and she continues to be an important part of Emma’s life after the marriage. Her easygoing, patient
        nature contrasts with some of the more volatile characters in the novel.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Mr. Weston Role: Mrs. Weston’s husband, a good-natured and sociable man. Characteristics: Mr. Weston is upbeat, cheerful, and friendly. He’s quite
        optimistic about life and events, enjoying the company of others and playing a central role in the local social scene. His marriage to Mrs. Weston is a
        happy one, and he is also proud of his son, Frank Churchill, from a previous marriage, though he has not been closely involved in Frank’s upbringing.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Mr. George Knightley Role: Emma’s brother-in-law and later her love interest. Characteristics: Mr. Knightley is sensible, mature, and a moral compass
        for Emma. As one of the few people who openly criticizes Emma’s behavior, he helps her realize her mistakes, especially regarding her meddling in other
        people’s lives. Though somewhat reserved, he is caring and deeply concerned for Emma’s well-being. His honesty and integrity make him a strong,
        admirable figure in the novel, and his relationship with Emma deepens as the story progresses.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Frank Churchill Role: Mr. Weston’s son from his first marriage and a key figure in the romantic entanglements of the novel. Characteristics: Frank is
        charming, handsome, and generally well-liked, but he can be deceitful and irresponsible at times. His flirtation with Emma is misleading, as he is
        secretly engaged to Jane Fairfax. Frank’s behavior is often self-serving, as he conceals his true intentions, leading to confusion and
        misunderstandings. However, he is ultimately shown to be affectionate and genuinely caring towards Jane.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Jane Fairfax Role: A beautiful, accomplished young woman and the secret fiancée of Frank Churchill. Characteristics: Jane is quiet, reserved, and
        somewhat mysterious, creating an air of intrigue around her. She is admired for her beauty and talents (particularly her musical abilities), but her
        restrained nature makes her difficult for Emma and others to understand. Despite her modest circumstances, Jane is dignified and self-contained,
        contrasting sharply with Emma’s more dominant personality.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. Harriet Smith Role: A close friend of Emma, whom Emma tries to mold into a suitable social match. Characteristics: Harriet is sweet, naive, and
        easily influenced by Emma. She is of uncertain parentage and has a lower social standing than Emma, but Emma takes her under her wing, attempting to
        elevate her in society. Harriet’s admiration for Emma leads her to follow Emma’s often misguided advice, especially in matters of love. Though lacking
        in Emma’s intelligence, Harriet is kind-hearted and eager to please.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Mr. Robert Martin Role: A local farmer and suitor of Harriet Smith. Characteristics: Mr. Martin is hardworking, honest, and respectable, though of a
        lower social rank than many other characters. He is sincerely in love with Harriet, and though Emma initially discourages Harriet from accepting his
        proposal, his genuine character eventually wins Harriet’s affections. He represents a contrast to the more polished but insincere Frank Churchill.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Mr. Elton Role: A local vicar who becomes the object of Emma’s misguided matchmaking efforts. Characteristics: Mr. Elton is self-important,
        ambitious, and vain. Emma mistakenly believes he is interested in Harriet, when in fact he harbors aspirations of marrying Emma herself to improve his
        social standing. When Emma rejects him, he quickly marries another woman of wealth, demonstrating his opportunistic and superficial nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Mrs. Elton Role: Mr. Elton’s new wife, a wealthy but vulgar woman. Characteristics: Mrs. Elton is snobbish, pretentious, and intrusive, quickly
        trying to impose her opinions and tastes on everyone around her. She is highly self-absorbed, referring to her possessions and experiences in a boastful
        manner. Her lack of social grace and overbearing personality make her unpopular, especially with Emma.
      </li>
      <li>
        13. Mr. Churchill (Frank’s uncle by marriage) Role: The man who raised Frank Churchill after his mother’s death, alongside his wife. Characteristics:
        Although Mr. Churchill is not a central character in terms of action, he plays a role in shaping Frank’s upbringing. He and his wife exert control over
        Frank, preventing him from pursuing his relationship with Jane Fairfax publicly. Mr. Churchill is relatively passive compared to his domineering wife.
      </li>
      <li>
        14. Mrs. Churchill (Frank’s aunt by marriage) Role: Frank Churchill’s overbearing aunt, who raises him after his mother’s death. Characteristics: Mrs.
        Churchill is a controlling, domineering woman who exerts great influence over Frank. She is seen as a figure of authority, and Frank feels obligated to
        comply with her wishes, which complicates his secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Churchill’s illness and eventual death play a crucial role in the
        resolution of Frank and Jane’s relationship.

      <li><b> SUMMARY:- </b></li>
      <li>
        Since Emma is a novel and not written as a traditional play with acts, I will summarize it by breaking the key events into major "acts" or sections to
        align it more closely with the typical structure of a play.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1: Introduction to Characters and Social Setting Emma Woodhouse is a young, intelligent, and wealthy woman living in Highbury. She prides herself on
        being a matchmaker, having successfully brought together her friend Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston. After Miss Taylor marries, Emma takes Harriet Smith, a
        young, naive girl, under her wing. Emma tries to guide Harriet into a higher social sphere, despite Harriet’s humble background. Emma convinces Harriet
        to reject a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable farmer, because she believes Harriet can do better. Emma sets her sights on matchmaking
        Harriet with Mr. Elton, the local vicar, though Harriet has feelings for him.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: Emma's Misjudgments Mr. Elton turns out to be interested in Emma, not Harriet, which shocks Emma. When Mr. Elton proposes to Emma, she firmly
        rejects him, and he leaves for a while. Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son, arrives in Highbury and catches Emma's attention. She flirts with him and
        believes he might be a potential suitor for herself. Meanwhile, Jane Fairfax, a reserved but accomplished young woman, comes to visit Highbury. Emma
        feels an irrational jealousy towards Jane, suspecting her of being a rival for Frank's affections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Confusion and Secret Engagement Emma’s matchmaking attempts go further awry. She pushes Harriet toward Frank Churchill, but Harriet actually
        grows infatuated with Mr. Knightley, a close family friend of Emma's. It is revealed that Frank Churchill has secretly been engaged to Jane Fairfax all
        along. His flirtation with Emma was a cover to hide his real feelings for Jane, causing embarrassment and confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: Self-Realization and Resolution After discovering Harriet’s interest in Mr. Knightley, Emma is forced to confront her own feelings. She realizes
        she loves Mr. Knightley herself and has been blind to it. Mr. Knightley also realizes his love for Emma and proposes to her, which she happily accepts.
        In the end, Harriet reconciles with Robert Martin and agrees to marry him. All misunderstandings are resolved, and the characters find happiness in
        their appropriate social standings and relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: Emma learns important lessons about self-awareness, humility, and the consequences of meddling in other people’s lives. The novel ends with
        marriages and social harmony restored, fulfilling the comedic and romantic tradition of Jane Austen's works.
