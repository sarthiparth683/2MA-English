      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>
        Since Emma is a novel and not written as a traditional play with acts, I
        will summarize it by breaking the key events into major "acts" or
        sections to align it more closely with the typical structure of a play.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1: Introduction to Characters and Social Setting Emma Woodhouse is a
        young, intelligent, and wealthy woman living in Highbury. She prides
        herself on being a matchmaker, having successfully brought together her
        friend Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston. After Miss Taylor marries, Emma takes
        Harriet Smith, a young, naive girl, under her wing. Emma tries to guide
        Harriet into a higher social sphere, despite Harriet’s humble
        background. Emma convinces Harriet to reject a marriage proposal from
        Robert Martin, a respectable farmer, because she believes Harriet can do
        better. Emma sets her sights on matchmaking Harriet with Mr. Elton, the
        local vicar, though Harriet has feelings for him.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: Emma's Misjudgments Mr. Elton turns out to be interested in Emma,
        not Harriet, which shocks Emma. When Mr. Elton proposes to Emma, she
        firmly rejects him, and he leaves for a while. Frank Churchill, Mr.
        Weston's son, arrives in Highbury and catches Emma's attention. She
        flirts with him and believes he might be a potential suitor for herself.
        Meanwhile, Jane Fairfax, a reserved but accomplished young woman, comes
        to visit Highbury. Emma feels an irrational jealousy towards Jane,
        suspecting her of being a rival for Frank's affections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Confusion and Secret Engagement Emma’s matchmaking attempts go
        further awry. She pushes Harriet toward Frank Churchill, but Harriet
        actually grows infatuated with Mr. Knightley, a close family friend of
        Emma's. It is revealed that Frank Churchill has secretly been engaged to
        Jane Fairfax all along. His flirtation with Emma was a cover to hide his
        real feelings for Jane, causing embarrassment and confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: Self-Realization and Resolution After discovering Harriet’s
        interest in Mr. Knightley, Emma is forced to confront her own feelings.
        She realizes she loves Mr. Knightley herself and has been blind to it.
        Mr. Knightley also realizes his love for Emma and proposes to her, which
        she happily accepts. In the end, Harriet reconciles with Robert Martin
        and agrees to marry him. All misunderstandings are resolved, and the
        characters find happiness in their appropriate social standings and
        relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: Emma learns important lessons about self-awareness,
        humility, and the consequences of meddling in other people’s lives. The
        novel ends with marriages and social harmony restored, fulfilling the
        comedic and romantic tradition of Jane Austen's works.
