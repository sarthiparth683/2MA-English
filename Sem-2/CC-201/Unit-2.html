      <li><h1>John Keats: Ode to a Nightingale.</h1></li>
      <li>written and published in 1819.</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Stanza 1 The poem begins with the speaker feeling as if he has taken
        poison or an opiate, feeling numb and drowsy. He isn’t envious of the
        nightingale but deeply moved by its song, which makes him long for a
        sense of escape from life's hardships. The bird represents a kind of
        timeless beauty and freedom, which the speaker admires.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 2 The speaker expresses a desire to escape the world through wine
        or some other kind of oblivion, so he can join the nightingale in its
        carefree existence. He contrasts the bird's joyous state with the
        sorrows of human life, filled with illness, weariness, and despair.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 3 In this stanza, the speaker laments the harsh realities of
        life, such as aging, suffering, and the inevitable approach of death. He
        admires the nightingale because it lives outside of these concerns,
        seemingly immortal in its continuous song, while humans must suffer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4 Instead of using alcohol to escape, the speaker decides that he
        will follow the bird through the power of his imagination or "fancy." He
        feels that poetry can lift him into the same ideal world as the
        nightingale inhabits, away from his earthly troubles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 5 Here, the speaker feels as if he is transported into a dark,
        mysterious forest where the nightingale’s song dominates. The darkness
        makes him more aware of other senses—the scent of flowers, the feel of
        the air—while he listens to the bird, who remains unseen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 6 The speaker contemplates death, feeling that it would be sweet
        to die while listening to the nightingale’s beautiful song. He imagines
        death as a form of peaceful release, but then realizes that while he
        would be gone, the bird’s song would continue, indifferent to his fate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 7 The speaker praises the nightingale as an eternal symbol, whose
        song has been heard by countless generations throughout history. He
        reflects on how the bird’s song transcends time, having been heard by
        emperors and commoners alike, even by Biblical figures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 8 As the nightingale’s song fades away, the speaker is pulled
        back to reality. He is unsure whether his experience with the bird and
        his imaginative journey was a dream or real. The poem ends on a note of
        uncertainty, with the speaker unsure of the boundaries between dreams
        and reality.
      </li>
      <li>
        In summary, the poem explores the tension between the harshness of human
        life and the beauty of the nightingale's song, a symbol of timeless and
        carefree existence.

      <li>Written - 1819</li>
      <li>Published in - 1820</li>
      <li>Ode - means a particualar topic eg. nature, river , mountain etc</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley is a powerful and vivid
        poem that expresses the poet's deep emotions and profound thoughts about
        nature, revolution, and personal transformation. The poem is divided
        into five stanzas, each with a distinct focus and theme.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Stanza: In the first stanza, Shelley addresses the West Wind as a
        powerful, almost godlike force of nature. He describes how the wind
        sweeps through the autumn landscape, driving away the dead leaves . The
        West Wind is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver—it scatters
        the dead leaves, but it also carries seeds to new places, allowing for
        rebirth in the spring. The wind’s power over the earth is emphasized,
        setting the tone for the rest of the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Stanza: The second stanza shifts focus to the wind's influence
        over the sky. How the West Wind moves the clouds, driving them across
        the sky and “angels of rain and lightning.” The sky is painted as a
        stormy, chaotic force, with the wind acting as a charioteer, guiding the
        storm clouds that bring rain and thunder. This imagery reflects the
        wind’s power to both create and destroy, emphasizing its role in the
        natural cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Stanza: impact on the sea. He describes how the West Wind stirs
        the oceans, causing waves to rise and even affecting the deep-sea
        plants. The imagery of the wind awakening the “blue Mediterranean” and
        affecting the “Atlantic’s level powers” highlights the wind’s
        omnipresence and its ability to move and change even the deepest parts
        of nature. The wind’s reach extends from the surface to the depths of
        the earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth Stanza: The fourth stanza marks a shift from the external to the
        internal relationship. He laments how he once was as free and powerful
        as the wind, but now feels weighed down by the burdens of life. He
        expresses a deep yearning to be lifted up and carried away by the wind,
        asking the West Wind to so that he might once again feel the same
        freedom and inspiration that the wind embodies. This stanza reflects
        Shelley's desire for personal rejuvenation and transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifth Stanza:Spread his thoughts and ideas across the world, just as it
        spreads leaves and seeds. He asks the wind to inspire change and
        revolution, much like the wind inspires rebirth in nature. The famous
        concluding lines, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” suggest
        hope and renewal, implying that even in the darkest times, change and
        rebirth are inevitable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, Ode to the West Wind is a deeply emotional and philosophical
        poem that explores themes of nature, change, and the poet’s own
        aspirations for personal and societal transformation. Each stanza builds
        upon the last, creating a vivid and dynamic portrayal of the wind's
        power and significance.
