      <li><h1>John Keats: Ode to a Nightingale.</h1></li>
      <li>written and published in 1819.</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        The speaker is overwhelmed by the beauty of the nightingale's song. He
        feels a drowsy numbness, but assures the bird it's not envy, rather a
        deep sharing of its joy. The song transports him to a world of lush
        greenery and summer abundance. The beauty of the song confronts the
        speaker with his own mortality. The speaker ponders death, considering
        it almost preferable to his current state. He longs to escape the
        world's harsh realities and dwell permanently in the blissful world
        evoked by the song. However, he recognizes this escape is impossible.
        The nightingale's song, he reasons, will continue long after he's gone,
        unable to be appreciated by his deafened ears.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speaker wrestles with the limitations of human experience. He
        imagines a fantastical escape, wishing to drink deep of the song and fly
        away with the nightingale. But reality intrudes â€“ his imagination fails
        him. The poem ends with the speaker questioning whether the whole
        experience was even real, blurring the lines between dream and waking
        life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes explored in the poem include: Nature as a source of beauty and
        escape The contrast between human mortality and the seeming immortality
        of art and nature The limits of human experience and imagination The
        bittersweetness of beauty

      <li>Written - 1819</li>

      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        In "Ode to the West Wind," Percy Bysshe Shelley addresses the powerful
        autumn wind, personifying it as a force of both destruction and
        creation. The poem unfolds in five sections:
      </li>
      <li>
        1. The Wind's Power in Nature: The speaker begins by calling out to the
        "wild West Wind," describing its role in scattering dead leaves and
        spreading seeds for future growth. He highlights the wind's duality - a
        destroyer and preserver - and pleads for the wind to hear his plea.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The Wind's Fury: The speaker elaborates on the wind's destructive
        power, depicting it as the "dirge / Of the dying year" that stirs
        violent storms. He emphasizes the wind's immense strength, using vivid
        imagery of churning seas and trembling ocean foliage. Again, he implores
        the wind to listen.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. The Wind's Global Influence: The focus shifts to the wind's vast
        reach. The speaker describes how it awakens the Mediterranean from its
        summer slumber and cleaves the Atlantic into turbulent waves. He
        emphasizes the wind's impact on all corners of the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The Speaker's Longing: The poem takes a more personal turn. The
        speaker expresses a desire to be like a dead leaf or a swift cloud,
        carried by the wind and experiencing its raw power. He yearns to become
        part of the wind's transformative energy.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. The Speaker's Transformation: The speaker makes his most significant
        plea. He asks the West Wind to transform him into a "lyre," a harp-like
        instrument. With this transformation, his words would be carried by the
        wind, scattered like seeds, and have the potential to inspire change and
        awaken minds, just as the wind awakens nature. The poem ends with a note
        of optimism, suggesting that even in the face of destruction (winter),
        there is always the promise of renewal (spring).
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, the poem explores themes of nature's power, the creative
        spirit, the role of the poet, and the yearning for change and a better
        world.
