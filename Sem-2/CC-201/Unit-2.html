      <li><h1>John Keats: Ode to a Nightingale.</h1></li>
      <li>written and published in 1819.</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Stanza 1: In the opening stanza, the speaker expresses a feeling of
        overwhelming sadness. He feels as though he has drunk hemlock or some
        other poisonous drink that causes numbness. This is not because he
        envies the nightingale, but because its singing fills him with such
        melancholy that it seems too beautiful for the world. The speaker feels
        weighed down by the heaviness of his emotions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 2: Here, the speaker wishes for wine to transport him away from
        the worries of the world. He imagines that drinking will allow him to
        escape to the world of the nightingale, free from the painful realities
        of life. He longs for an idyllic, carefree existence where he can be as
        joyous as the bird, free from earthly concerns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 3: The speaker reflects on the suffering of human life: aging,
        sickness, and the inevitable death that everyone must face. He contrasts
        this harsh reality with the timeless song of the nightingale, which
        seems to live outside of the bounds of time. He wishes he could escape
        this suffering and join the nightingale in its eternal, carefree
        existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4: In this stanza, the speaker imagines escaping not through wine
        but through poetry. He believes poetry can lift him to the nightingale's
        world, where he can forget the sorrows of human life. The darkness of
        the physical world does not bother him, as he feels carried away by the
        beauty and music of the nightingale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 5: The speaker describes the natural world as a beautiful,
        mysterious place. He focuses on the sensual experience of being
        surrounded by flowers and the night air, though he cannot see them in
        the darkness. He seems to find comfort in the natural world, which is
        filled with the same beauty and vitality as the nightingale's song.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 6: Here, the speaker contemplates death and seems to embrace the
        idea of dying peacefully while listening to the nightingale's song. He
        imagines that passing away in such a state would be painless and serene,
        with the bird's eternal music continuing on, even after his death.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 7: The speaker reflects on the immortality of the nightingale's
        song. The bird has sung for centuries, bringing joy to various
        generations, from ancient kings to simple people. Its song transcends
        time, remaining constant, while human lives are transient. This eternal
        quality of the nightingale contrasts with the brevity of human
        existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 8: In the final stanza, the speaker is pulled back to reality.
        The nightingale's song fades, leaving him uncertain about whether his
        experience was real or just a dream. The moment of transcendence is
        over, and he is left to ponder whether the beautiful escape provided by
        the bird's song was just an illusion. He ends by questioning whether he
        has been truly awake or dreaming.

      <li><h1>P.B. Shelley: Ode to the West Wind</h1></li>
      <li>Written - 1819</li>
      <li>Published in - 1820</li>
      <li>Ode - means a particualar topic eg. nature, river , mountain etc</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley is a powerful and vivid
        poem that expresses the poet's deep emotions and profound thoughts about
        nature, revolution, and personal transformation. The poem is divided
        into five stanzas, each with a distinct focus and theme.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Stanza: In the first stanza, Shelley addresses the West Wind as a
        powerful, almost godlike force of nature. He describes how the wind
        sweeps through the autumn landscape, driving away the dead leaves . The
        West Wind is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver—it scatters
        the dead leaves, but it also carries seeds to new places, allowing for
        rebirth in the spring. The wind’s power over the earth is emphasized,
        setting the tone for the rest of the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Stanza: The second stanza shifts focus to the wind's influence
        over the sky. How the West Wind moves the clouds, driving them across
        the sky and “angels of rain and lightning.” The sky is painted as a
        stormy, chaotic force, with the wind acting as a charioteer, guiding the
        storm clouds that bring rain and thunder. This imagery reflects the
        wind’s power to both create and destroy, emphasizing its role in the
        natural cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Stanza: impact on the sea. He describes how the West Wind stirs
        the oceans, causing waves to rise and even affecting the deep-sea
        plants. The imagery of the wind awakening the “blue Mediterranean” and
        affecting the “Atlantic’s level powers” highlights the wind’s
        omnipresence and its ability to move and change even the deepest parts
        of nature. The wind’s reach extends from the surface to the depths of
        the earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth Stanza: The fourth stanza marks a shift from the external to the
        internal relationship. He laments how he once was as free and powerful
        as the wind, but now feels weighed down by the burdens of life. He
        expresses a deep yearning to be lifted up and carried away by the wind,
        asking the West Wind to so that he might once again feel the same
        freedom and inspiration that the wind embodies. This stanza reflects
        Shelley's desire for personal rejuvenation and transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifth Stanza:Spread his thoughts and ideas across the world, just as it
        spreads leaves and seeds. He asks the wind to inspire change and
        revolution, much like the wind inspires rebirth in nature. The famous
        concluding lines, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” suggest
        hope and renewal, implying that even in the darkest times, change and
        rebirth are inevitable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, Ode to the West Wind is a deeply emotional and philosophical
        poem that explores themes of nature, change, and the poet’s own
        aspirations for personal and societal transformation. Each stanza builds
        upon the last, creating a vivid and dynamic portrayal of the wind's
        power and significance.
