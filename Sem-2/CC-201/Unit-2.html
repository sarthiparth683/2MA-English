      <li><h1>John Keats: Ode to a Nightingale.</h1></li>
      <li>written and published in 1819.</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        The speaker is overwhelmed by the beauty of the nightingale's song. He
        feels a drowsy numbness, but assures the bird it's not envy, rather a
        deep sharing of its joy. The song transports him to a world of lush
        greenery and summer abundance. The beauty of the song confronts the
        speaker with his own mortality. The speaker ponders death, considering
        it almost preferable to his current state. He longs to escape the
        world's harsh realities and dwell permanently in the blissful world
        evoked by the song. However, he recognizes this escape is impossible.
        The nightingale's song, he reasons, will continue long after he's gone,
        unable to be appreciated by his deafened ears.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speaker wrestles with the limitations of human experience. He
        imagines a fantastical escape, wishing to drink deep of the song and fly
        away with the nightingale. But reality intrudes – his imagination fails
        him. The poem ends with the speaker questioning whether the whole
        experience was even real, blurring the lines between dream and waking
        life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes explored in the poem include: Nature as a source of beauty and
        escape The contrast between human mortality and the seeming immortality
        of art and nature The limits of human experience and imagination The
        bittersweetness of beauty

      <li>Written - 1819</li>
      <li>Published in - 1820</li>
      <li>Ode - means a particualar topic eg. nature, river , mountain etc</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley is a powerful and vivid
        poem that expresses the poet's deep emotions and profound thoughts about
        nature, revolution, and personal transformation. The poem is divided
        into five stanzas, each with a distinct focus and theme.
      </li>
      <li>
        First Stanza: In the first stanza, Shelley addresses the West Wind as a
        powerful, almost godlike force of nature. He describes how the wind
        sweeps through the autumn landscape, driving away the dead leaves . The
        West Wind is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver—it scatters
        the dead leaves, but it also carries seeds to new places, allowing for
        rebirth in the spring. The wind’s power over the earth is emphasized,
        setting the tone for the rest of the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second Stanza: The second stanza shifts focus to the wind's influence
        over the sky. How the West Wind moves the clouds, driving them across
        the sky and “angels of rain and lightning.” The sky is painted as a
        stormy, chaotic force, with the wind acting as a charioteer, guiding the
        storm clouds that bring rain and thunder. This imagery reflects the
        wind’s power to both create and destroy, emphasizing its role in the
        natural cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Stanza: impact on the sea. He describes how the West Wind stirs
        the oceans, causing waves to rise and even affecting the deep-sea
        plants. The imagery of the wind awakening the “blue Mediterranean” and
        affecting the “Atlantic’s level powers” highlights the wind’s
        omnipresence and its ability to move and change even the deepest parts
        of nature. The wind’s reach extends from the surface to the depths of
        the earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth Stanza: The fourth stanza marks a shift from the external to the
        internal relationship. He laments how he once was as free and powerful
        as the wind, but now feels weighed down by the burdens of life. He
        expresses a deep yearning to be lifted up and carried away by the wind,
        asking the West Wind to so that he might once again feel the same
        freedom and inspiration that the wind embodies. This stanza reflects
        Shelley's desire for personal rejuvenation and transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifth Stanza:Spread his thoughts and ideas across the world, just as it
        spreads leaves and seeds. He asks the wind to inspire change and
        revolution, much like the wind inspires rebirth in nature. The famous
        concluding lines, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” suggest
        hope and renewal, implying that even in the darkest times, change and
        rebirth are inevitable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, Ode to the West Wind is a deeply emotional and philosophical
        poem that explores themes of nature, change, and the poet’s own
        aspirations for personal and societal transformation. Each stanza builds
        upon the last, creating a vivid and dynamic portrayal of the wind's
        power and significance.
