      <li><h1>W.B. Yeats: The Second Coming</h1></li> 
      <li>
        W.B. Yeats' "The Second Coming" is a dark and powerful poem written in
        the aftermath of World War I. It reflects the disillusionment and
        anxieties of a world forever changed by the war's brutality. Here's a
        full summary:
      </li>
      <li>
        The World in Chaos: The poem opens with the image of a "widening gyre,"
        a reference to Yeats' personal philosophy of history, which saw
        civilization move in cycles. This widening gyre suggests a world at the
        tipping point of a major change. The "centre cannot hold" signifies a
        breakdown of order and stability. The old systems and beliefs are
        crumbling.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Monstrous Birth: The poem speaks of a terrifying "beast slouching
        towards Bethlehem to be born." This beast is a symbol of the coming
        chaos and violence. It's unclear if it represents a specific figure or a
        more general sense of impending doom. Bethlehem, the birthplace of
        Jesus, is associated with hope and salvation in Christianity. Here, it's
        twisted to represent the birthplace of something monstrous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loss of Certainty: The poem describes a world where the best lack all
        conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.
        Traditional values and beliefs are fading, replaced by a sense of moral
        ambiguity. The falcon can no longer hear the falconer, symbolizing a
        breakdown in communication and order. The established ways of thinking
        are no longer relevant.
      </li>
      <li>
        A New Era Dawns: The poem ends with a haunting image of a rough beast,
        rocking cradle and coughing out a barbarous phrase. The future seems
        bleak and filled with violence. However, some interpretations suggest
        the "rocking cradle" signifies the birth of a new era, even if it's a
        harsh one. The "barbarous phrase" could be the birth cry of a new world
        order.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, "The Second Coming" is a poem about the disintegration of the
        old world and the uncertain arrival of a new one. It's a reflection of
        the anxieties and fears of a world grappling with the aftermath of a
        devastating war.
