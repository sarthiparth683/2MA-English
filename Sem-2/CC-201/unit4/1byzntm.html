        Sailing to Byzantium: A Full Summary W.B. Yeats' "Sailing to Byzantium"
        is a profound poem that grapples with aging, the limitations of the
        physical body, and the yearning for a kind of immortality. Here's a
        breakdown of the poem's journey:
      </li>
      <li>
        The Speaker's Frustration: The poem opens with the speaker, an old man,
        lamenting the fading passion and beauty associated with youth. He feels
        his "blood dropping from the drowsy head" and compares his diminishing
        vigor to "dying animal." The world he inhabits seems to celebrate the
        fleeting beauty and desires of youth, leaving no space for the wisdom
        and experience of the aged.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Call of Byzantium: Yearning for a place that values something beyond
        the physical, the speaker sets his sights on Byzantium. Byzantium, a
        historical center of art, culture, and spirituality (once
        Constantinople, now Istanbul), becomes a symbol for the speaker. It
        represents a world of enduring beauty and knowledge, untouched by the
        ravages of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Lure of Art and Transformation: In Byzantium, the speaker seeks not
        a youthful body, but a transformation. He desires to become a part of
        the city's magnificent art, particularly the golden mosaics bathed in
        firelight. These mosaics represent a kind of immortality, an existence
        beyond the decay of the physical world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transcending Mortality Through Art: The speaker imagines himself as a
        crafted object, like a singer sculpted from gold and ivory. In this
        form, he envisions being played upon by the "singing-masters" of
        Byzantium, his soul transformed into eternal music.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Final Vision: The poem ends with the speaker contemplating a world
        of artifice and artistic creation. He finds solace in the idea that his
        emotions and experiences, though fading in the physical world, can be
        captured and immortalized through art.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes Explored: The poem explores the human desire for meaning and
        legacy in the face of mortality. It contrasts the fleeting nature of
        physical beauty with the enduring power of art and the human spirit.
        Yeats also grapples with the role of the artist in society and the
        possibility of transcending the limitations of the human body.
