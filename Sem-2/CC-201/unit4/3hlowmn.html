      <li><h1>T.S. Eliot: The Hollow Man</h1></li>
      <li>
        T.S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men" isn't about a single hollow man, but a
        whole society grappling with emptiness in the wake of World War I.
        Here's a breakdown of the poem's journey:

      <li>  
        Setting the Scene (Part 1): The poem opens with epigraphs hinting at the
        emptiness to come. We meet the central characters: a group of hollow
        men, like scarecrows, with meaningless words and paralyzed bodies. Dead
        ancestors, across a mysterious river, judge them silently.

      <li>
        Fear and Futility (Parts 2 & 3): The hollow men fear being judged by the
        dead, even in sleep. They attempt a prayer but fail, highlighting their
        spiritual disconnect. The imagery shifts to a desolate desert with a
        swollen river, reflecting their emotional state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parody and Despair (Part 4): The hollow men perform a grotesque dance
        around a cactus, reciting a twisted nursery rhyme. A mocking exchange
        follows, mimicking a Christian service but filled with despair.
      </li>
      <li>
        Disintegration and Whimper (Part 5): The shadow of death paralyzes
        everything. The hollow men try to recite the Lord's Prayer, but their
        language crumbles. The poem ends with the famous lines: "This is the way
        the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper," signifying a quiet,
        uneventful decay.
      </li>

        Key Points: The poem is a metaphor for the spiritual and moral emptiness
        of post-war society. It explores themes of disillusionment, religious
        doubt, and the search for meaning in a broken world. The hollow men
        represent a generation stripped of hope and purpose. Further
        Exploration: Consider how Eliot uses imagery like the desert, cactus,
        and the river to depict desolation. Explore the poem's allusions to
        Dante's Inferno and the fragmented nature of language.
