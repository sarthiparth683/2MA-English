      <li><h1>T.S. Eliot:Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1></li>
      <li>
        T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" is a landmark of
        modernist poetry, delving into the anxieties and disillusionment of the
        modern world. Here's a full summary:
      </li>
      <li>   
        The Speaker and Setting: The poem is a dramatic monologue spoken by J.  
        Alfred Prufrock, a middle-aged, self-conscious man. He invites an
        unnamed listener ("you") on an imagined evening walk through a crowded
        city.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prufrock's Internal Struggles: Prufrock is riddled with self-doubt and
        social anxieties. He feels like an outsider in the bustling social scene
        he describes. He fears judgment and ridicule, comparing himself to aging
        arms and legs "too weak to carry me." He longs for connection but
        hesitates to make a move, wondering if he dares to "disturb the
        universe" by expressing his feelings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Love and Longing: Prufrock seems to be drawn to a woman he imagines
        attending a social gathering. He contemplates expressing his love but
        feels inadequate. The poem's title, "Love Song," is ironic. It's less a
        song of love and more a lament about his inability to act on his
        desires.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Fragmented Modern World: Eliot uses fragmented imagery and shifts in
        thought to reflect Prufrock's fractured mental state. The poem is full
        of allusions to mythology, literature, and history, which Prufrock uses
        to grapple with his place in the vast scheme of things. The city itself
        becomes a symbol of modern alienation, with its "yellow fog" and sterile
        conversations.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Unvoiced Question: The poem ends with a series of unanswered
        questions about mermaids singing and human existence. These questions
        leave the reader pondering the meaning of life, love, and finding
        connection in a fragmented world. Overall, "The Love Song of J. Alfred
        Prufrock" is a powerful exploration of alienation, self-consciousness,
        and the struggle to find meaning in the modern world.
