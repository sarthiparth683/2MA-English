      <li><h1>Dylan Thomas: Fern Hill</h1></li>
      <li>Here's a full summary of Dylan Thomas's poem "Fern Hill":</li>
      <li>
        The Poem's Landscape The poem paints a vivid picture of Fern Hill, a
        farm where the speaker spent his childhood summers. Lush greenery, apple
        trees, and a starry night sky create a sense of idyllic beauty and
        harmony with nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Childhood Innocence The speaker reminisces about his youth, using bright
        and carefree language. He describes himself as "young and easy" under
        the apple boughs, completely happy and carefree like the green grass.
        Time seems endless, and the days are filled with endless joy.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Deeper Look The middle section expands on this idyllic scene. The
        poem's rhythm becomes lilting, mirroring the carefree nature of the
        speaker's memories. Rich metaphors compare the farm to a paradise, with
        allusions to the Garden of Eden. The speaker describes himself as part
        of the natural world, climbing trees, chasing after cows, and swimming
        in the brook.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Shift in Tone The poem takes a subtle turn towards the end. A hint of
        melancholy creeps in as the speaker acknowledges the passage of time. He
        realizes that his childhood summers at Fern Hill won't last forever. The
        line "Time held me green and dying" suggests a growing awareness of
        mortality and the inevitable loss of innocence.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Power of Memory Despite the approaching adulthood, the speaker finds
        solace in the act of remembering. He vows to "eat the sunlight whole"
        and "praise cows leaping over fences." By capturing these memories in
        words, he hopes to preserve a piece of his childhood joy even as time
        marches on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes "Fern Hill" explores themes of: Childhood Innocence: The poem
        celebrates the carefree happiness and wonder of childhood. Nature: The
        natural world at Fern Hill is a source of beauty, joy, and connection
        for the speaker. Loss of Innocence: The poem acknowledges the
        bittersweet reality of growing up and losing the simplicity of
        childhood. The Power of Memory: The act of remembering allows the
        speaker to preserve a part of his past.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall "Fern Hill" is a beautiful and nostalgic poem that captures the
        essence of childhood summers spent in nature. It's a celebration of
        innocence laced with a touch of melancholy about the passage of time.

      <li><h1>W.H. Auden: The Unknown Citizen</h1></li>
      <li>
        W.H. Auden's poem "The Unknown Citizen" takes the form of a eulogy for a
        deceased citizen, but with a twist. It's not a heartfelt tribute, but
        rather a cold, clinical report, likely generated by a future government
        agency.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem details the life of this unknown citizen entirely through
        statistics and records. We learn about his voting record, consumption
        habits, family life, and even his leisure activities. However, none of
        these details reveal anything about the man himself, his thoughts,
        feelings, or individuality.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speaker, the government agency, portrays the unknown citizen as the
        ideal model. He consumed the right products, followed the rules, and
        caused no trouble. There's a dark irony here. While the report
        celebrates his conformity, it also highlights the complete lack of
        individuality and freedom.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem's final lines are particularly striking. The speaker ponders
        whether the unknown citizen was "free" or "happy," but then dismisses
        these questions. The bureaucratic system the poem represents cannot
        comprehend such subjective concepts.
      </li>
      <li>
        "The Unknown Citizen" is a satire that criticizes the dangers of
        excessive conformity and government control. It warns against a future
        where people are reduced to mere statistics, valued only for their
        obedience and contribution to a soulless society.

      <li>Characters:-</li>
      <li>
        1. Thetis - Role: Thetis is the mother of Achilles and a sea goddess in
        Greek mythology. Description: In the poem, Thetis is depicted as a
        concerned and anxious mother who inspects the shield being made for her
        son. 
        
        She expects to see scenes of heroism, beauty, and nobility depicted
        on her son's shield. She imagines glorious images of peace, prosperity,
        and honor.she is horrified by the bleak and desolate images that
        represent the harsh realities of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Hephaestus Role: Hephaestus is the god of fire and blacksmiths in
        Greek mythology, tasked with forging Achilles' shield. Description:
        Hephaestus is portrayed as the silent, skilled artisan creating the
        shield. He does not speak or express emotion in the poem but instead
        presents a stark, realistic depiction of the world. His work contrasts
        sharply with Thetis's expectations, as he crafts a shield that reflects
        the brutal and unheroic nature of modern warfare.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Achilles (Implied) Role: Achilles is the legendary Greek hero of the
        Trojan War. Description: Although Achilles does not appear directly in
        the poem, his presence is implied throughout. The shield is being made
        for him, and Thetis’s concern stems from the knowledge that Achilles
        will soon face his fate in battle. Achilles represents the doomed hero,
        destined for a tragic end, and the conflict between glory and the grim
        realities of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The Desolate Figures Role: Symbolic figures depicted on the shield.
        Description: The shield depicts various bleak scenes, including a
        "weed-choked field," "barbed wire enclosed," and "three pale figures"
        who represent the dehumanization and desolation of modern warfare. These
        figures are not specific characters but rather embodiments of suffering,
        despair, and the loss of humanity in the face of violence. They contrast
        with the heroic and noble images that Thetis expects.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. The Soldiers Role: Representations of soldiers in the modern world.
        Description: The soldiers depicted on the shield are portrayed as
        faceless and dehumanized, marching in unison with no individuality or
        heroism. They symbolize the mechanized, impersonal nature of modern
        warfare, where soldiers are reduced to mere cogs in the machinery of
        war.

      <li>Summary of "The Shield of Achilles" by W.H. Auden</li>
      <li>
        W.H. Auden's poem "The Shield of Achilles" contrasts the ancient world
        of myth with the harsh realities of the modern world. The poem is
        structured in two alternating perspectives: the mythological scene of
        Thetis looking at the shield and the contemporary vision of a barren,
        desolate landscape.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the first part of the poem, Thetis, the mother of Achilles, expects
        to see scenes of heroism, beauty, and nobility depicted on her son's
        shield. She imagines glorious images of peace, prosperity, and honor,
        typical of the classical age. These are the kinds of scenes that Homer
        described in his epic, where the shield was a symbol of heroic ideals
        and the beauty of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, what she actually sees on the shield is something entirely
        different. Instead of the expected pastoral scenes, Thetis sees a bleak,
        modern landscape. The shield shows an image of a desolate plain, where a
        crowd of faceless people are gathered, all under the watchful eyes of a
        tyrant. The atmosphere is one of oppression, cruelty, and despair. This
        contrast serves to highlight the difference between the idealized vision
        of the ancient world and the grim reality of the modern one.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem then shifts to describe a scene of violent and meaningless
        warfare. The soldiers are depicted as robotic and dehumanized, marching
        without purpose or glory. There is no honor or heroism in this battle,
        only death and destruction. This reflects Auden’s critique of modern
        warfare, which he sees as brutal and devoid of any noble purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the final part, the poem returns to Thetis, who is dismayed by the
        scenes on the shield. She realizes that the world her son will face is
        not one of heroism and honor, but one of suffering and futility. The
        shield, rather than being a symbol of protection and heroism, becomes a
        representation of the harsh realities of the modern world, where ideals
        have been replaced by brutality and despair.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, "The Shield of Achilles" is a powerful commentary on the
        disillusionment of the modern age, contrasting the ideals of the past
        with the grim realities of the present. Auden uses the imagery of the
        shield to explore themes of war, power, and the loss of innocence.
