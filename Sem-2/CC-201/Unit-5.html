      <li><h1>Dylan Thomas: Fern Hill</h1></li>
      <li>Here’s a stanza-wise summary of “Fern Hill” by Dylan Thomas:</li>
      <li>
        Stanza 1: The poem begins with the speaker reminiscing about his youth
        spent at Fern Hill, a place that symbolizes innocence and freedom. He
        describes how he was carefree, feeling as if time didn’t constrain him.
        He views nature as a playground, with the sun, moon, and countryside
        serving as companions in his blissful existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 2: The speaker reflects on the beauty of Fern Hill, comparing his
        experience there to being in an Eden-like paradise. He was so immersed
        in the idyllic life that he felt as though he was in perfect harmony
        with nature. Everything around him seemed new, fresh, and vibrant,
        reinforcing the sense of innocence and joy he experienced.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 3: Here, the speaker personifies time, suggesting that it let him
        live freely and happily in his youth. Time was not seen as something to
        be feared; instead, it was generous, giving him the freedom to live
        without worries. This stanza captures the speaker’s awe and wonder at
        the world, as he recalls being unburdened by the awareness of time’s
        passage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4: The speaker begins to recognize the inevitable changes that
        come with time. He uses imagery of the day transitioning into night,
        symbolizing the loss of innocence as he matures. Despite this, he still
        recalls the magic of his youthful days at Fern Hill, even as he realizes
        that those moments of freedom cannot last forever.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 5: The tone becomes more reflective and melancholic as the
        speaker acknowledges that his carefree days have ended. He sees that
        time, which once seemed to give him freedom, was also leading him toward
        adulthood and mortality. The speaker starts to grasp that the joy and
        innocence he once experienced were transient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 6: The final stanza is a meditation on the passage of time and
        the inevitable end of innocence. The speaker laments that he was "green
        and carefree" when young, but now, as an adult, he understands the
        constraints of time. He realizes that while he once felt invincible,
        time was always present, guiding him from the innocence of childhood
        toward the responsibilities and realities of adulthood.
      </li>
      <li>
        In summary, “Fern Hill” portrays the speaker’s nostalgic reflection on
        his childhood, where he once felt free and immortal, only to realize
        later in life that time was always shaping his destiny.

      <li><h1>W.H. Auden: The Unknown Citizen</h1></li>
      <li>
        W.H. Auden's poem "The Unknown Citizen" takes the form of a eulogy for a
        deceased citizen, but with a twist. It's not a heartfelt tribute, but
        rather a cold, clinical report, likely generated by a future government
        agency.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem details the life of this unknown citizen entirely through
        statistics and records. We learn about his voting record, consumption
        habits, family life, and even his leisure activities. However, none of
        these details reveal anything about the man himself, his thoughts,
        feelings, or individuality.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speaker, the government agency, portrays the unknown citizen as the
        ideal model. He consumed the right products, followed the rules, and
        caused no trouble. There's a dark irony here. While the report
        celebrates his conformity, it also highlights the complete lack of
        individuality and freedom.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem's final lines are particularly striking. The speaker ponders
        whether the unknown citizen was "free" or "happy," but then dismisses
        these questions. The bureaucratic system the poem represents cannot
        comprehend such subjective concepts.
      </li>
      <li>
        "The Unknown Citizen" is a satire that criticizes the dangers of
        excessive conformity and government control. It warns against a future
        where people are reduced to mere statistics, valued only for their
        obedience and contribution to a soulless society.

      <li>Characters:-</li>
      <li>
        1. Thetis - Role: Thetis is the mother of Achilles and a sea goddess in
        Greek mythology. Description: In the poem, Thetis is depicted as a
        concerned and anxious mother who inspects the shield being made for her
        son. She expects to see scenes of heroism, beauty, and nobility images
        of peace, prosperity, and honor.depicted on her son's shield. She

        represent the harsh realities of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Hephaestus Role: Hephaestus is the god of fire and blacksmiths in
        Greek mythology, tasked with forging Achilles' shield. Description:
        Hephaestus is portrayed as the silent, skilled artisan creating the
        shield. He does not speak or express emotion in the poem but instead
        presents a stark, realistic depiction of the world. His work contrasts
        sharply with Thetis's expectations, as he crafts a shield that reflects
        the brutal and unheroic nature of modern warfare.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Achilles (Implied) Role: Achilles is the legendary Greek hero of the
        Trojan War. Description: Although Achilles does not appear directly in
        the poem, his presence is implied throughout. The shield is being made
        for him, and Thetis’s concern stems from the knowledge that Achilles
        will soon face his fate in battle. Achilles represents the doomed hero,
        destined for a tragic end, and the conflict between glory and the grim
        realities of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The Desolate Figures Role: Symbolic figures depicted on the shield.
        Description: The shield depicts various bleak scenes, including a
        "weed-choked field," "barbed wire enclosed," and "three pale figures"
        who represent the dehumanization and desolation of modern warfare. These
        figures are not specific characters but rather embodiments of suffering,
        despair, and the loss of humanity in the face of violence. They contrast
        with the heroic and noble images that Thetis expects.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. The Soldiers Role: Representations of soldiers in the modern world.
        Description: The soldiers depicted on the shield are portrayed as
        faceless and dehumanized, marching in unison with no individuality or
        heroism. They symbolize the mechanized, impersonal nature of modern
        warfare, where soldiers are reduced to mere cogs in the machinery of
        war.

      <li>Summary of "The Shield of Achilles" by W.H. Auden</li>
      <li>
        W.H. Auden's poem "The Shield of Achilles" contrasts the ancient world
        of myth with the harsh realities of the modern world. The poem is
        structured in two alternating perspectives: the mythological scene of
        Thetis looking at the shield and the contemporary vision of a barren,
        desolate landscape.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the first part of the poem, Thetis, the mother of Achilles, expects
        to see scenes of heroism, beauty, and nobility depicted on her son's
        shield. She imagines glorious images of peace, prosperity, and honor,
        typical of the classical age. These are the kinds of scenes that Homer
        described in his epic, where the shield was a symbol of heroic ideals
        and the beauty of war.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, what she actually sees on the shield is something entirely
        different. Instead of the expected pastoral scenes, Thetis sees a bleak,
        modern landscape. The shield shows an image of a desolate plain, where a
        crowd of faceless people are gathered, all under the watchful eyes of a
        tyrant. The atmosphere is one of oppression, cruelty, and despair. This
        contrast serves to highlight the difference between the idealized vision
        of the ancient world and the grim reality of the modern one.
      </li>
      <li>
        The poem then shifts to describe a scene of violent and meaningless
        warfare. The soldiers are depicted as robotic and dehumanized, marching
        without purpose or glory. There is no honor or heroism in this battle,
        only death and destruction. This reflects Auden’s critique of modern
        warfare, which he sees as brutal and devoid of any noble purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the final part, the poem returns to Thetis, who is dismayed by the
        scenes on the shield. She realizes that the world her son will face is
        not one of heroism and honor, but one of suffering and futility. The
        shield, rather than being a symbol of protection and heroism, becomes a
        representation of the harsh realities of the modern world, where ideals
        have been replaced by brutality and despair.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, "The Shield of Achilles" is a powerful commentary on the
        disillusionment of the modern age, contrasting the ideals of the past
        with the grim realities of the present. Auden uses the imagery of the
        shield to explore themes of war, power, and the loss of innocence.
