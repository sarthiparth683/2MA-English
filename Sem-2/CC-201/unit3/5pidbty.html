        Summary:- Celebration of Variety and God's Creation Theme: The poem
        praises God for the beauty found in variety and the intricate details of
        the natural world. Structure: "Pied Beauty" is a shortened sonnet
        (curtal sonnet) with a unique rhyme scheme (ABC ABC).

        The poem opens with the word "Glory" and an appreciation for "dappled
        things" - objects with contrasting colors or markings. The speaker lists
        various examples: the "brightness" of the sky contrasted with
        "lawn-byes" (open spaces between woods), the "brinded" (streaked) cow,
        the "finnches' wings" with their colorful patterns. Even imperfections
        like freckles and speckled trout become objects of praise. The poem
        highlights the beauty of man-made objects too, like "willow-wrenches"
        (tools) and "counter," the grain counting tool used by farmers. The
        final line, "fathers forth as handiwork," emphasizes God's role as the
        creator who brings forth this diverse and beautiful world.

        Key Points Focus on Details: Hopkins doesn't just praise generic beauty;
        he finds wonder in the specific details - speckles, freckles, dappling.
        All Creation Matters: From the grand sky to the humble tools, everything
        is part of God's creation and worthy of praise. Awe and Wonder: The tone
        is one of awe and wonder at the richness and complexity of the world.
        Overall, "Pied Beauty" is a celebration of God's artistry in creating a
        world brimming with variety and exquisite detail.
