        "Pied Beauty" by Gerard Manley Hopkins is a hymn of praise to God for
        the variety and beauty of the natural world. Hopkins uses the word
        "pied" to refer to things that are variegated or multi-colored,
        appreciating God's creation for its diversity. Here's a stanza-wise
        summary of the poem:
      </li>
      <li>
        First Stanza (Lines 1-6): Hopkins begins by praising God for the beauty
        of things that are "pied" or variegatedâ€”those with contrasting colors or
        patterns. He highlights specific examples of these, such as the skies
        that are "couple-colour'd" (having different shades or colors), the
        spots on a trout, and the wings of a finch. He also mentions the
        contrast of colors seen in landscapes, fields, and farm animals. The
        essence of the stanza is to show how things with variety and
        imperfection still reflect God's perfect creation.
      </li>

        Second Stanza (Lines 7-11): The second stanza shifts slightly in focus.
        Here, Hopkins acknowledges that all of these varied and unique things
        are the product of God's creation. He praises God for His ability to
        create things that are "fickle" or changeable, "freckled" or spotted,
        and for the existence of contrasts like swift and slow, sweet and sour,
        and bright and dim. The stanza emphasizes that even opposites and
        contrasts contribute to the beauty and harmony of the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Final Line (12): Hopkins concludes with the phrase, "He fathers-forth
        whose beauty is past change: Praise Him." This final line glorifies God
        as the unchanging source of all this change and variety. Despite the
        diversity and contrasts in the world, God's beauty remains eternal and
        unaltered. In essence, "Pied Beauty" is a poem of appreciation for the
        diversity and complexity in nature, recognizing the divine hand behind
        all things that are seemingly imperfect or unusual.
