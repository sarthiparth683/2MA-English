        Stanza 1 The speaker describes the beautiful and tranquil scene of the
        moonlit sea at Dover Beach, looking out over the English Channel. The
        calmness and peacefulness of the setting are highlighted. However, the
        sound of the waves brings a sense of melancholy, suggesting that beneath
        the surface beauty, there is something deeper and sadder.

        Stanza 2 The speaker shifts to ancient Greece, recalling how the Greek
        playwright Sophocles also heard the sound of waves, which made him think
        of human misery. The eternal ebb and flow of the sea becomes a metaphor
        for human suffering, connecting the speaker's present feelings with the
        universal human condition across time.

        Stanza 3 The speaker laments the loss of faith in the modern world. He
        describes the “Sea of Faith” that once surrounded the world, providing
        comfort and certainty. But now, this faith is receding, leaving the
        world bare and exposed to uncertainty and confusion, just like a beach
        stripped of its waters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4 In the final stanza, the speaker turns to his companion and
        pleads for love and loyalty, as these are the only sources of comfort in
        a world filled with uncertainty and despair. He portrays the world as a
        place of chaos and struggle, where appearances can be deceptive, and
        where truth and joy are hard to find.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall Theme: The poem reflects on the decline of religious faith and
        the resulting feelings of uncertainty and isolation in the modern world.
        It emphasizes the need for love and human connection amidst the changing
        tides of existence.
