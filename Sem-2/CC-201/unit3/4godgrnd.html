        Stanza 1: Hopkins opens the poem by marveling at the majesty and power
        of God, which he compares to a shining, electrifying force—“The world is
        charged with the grandeur of God.” He suggests that this divine force is
        both like a bright light and like oil pressed from olives, which bursts
        forth under pressure. Despite this grandeur, Hopkins expresses sorrow
        and frustration over how humans seem blind to God's glory. They live
        without realizing the divine presence, constantly exploiting and
        degrading nature through their daily activities. "Generations have trod,
        have trod, have trod" – humanity repeatedly abuses nature. Hopkins
        emphasizes the negative impact of industrialization—through human
        effort, the earth is being spoiled and “smeared with toil,” and the
        spiritual connection to nature seems lost.

        Stanza 2: Despite the damage humans cause, Hopkins finds hope in the
        enduring power of nature and the divine spirit. He believes that nature
        is resilient, always capable of renewing itself, and cannot be
        completely destroyed by human actions. There is a continual rebirth in
        nature—“And for all this, nature is never spent.” "The Holy Ghost over
        the bent world broods" – the final image is one of protection and care.
        Hopkins envisions the Holy Spirit as a bird, like a mother hen,
        sheltering the world under its wings and ensuring its safety and
        renewal. The poem ends with a sense of comfort and optimism. No matter
        what humans do, God's grandeur continues to shine, and nature, under the
        watchful eye of the Holy Spirit, will always rejuvenate itself.
