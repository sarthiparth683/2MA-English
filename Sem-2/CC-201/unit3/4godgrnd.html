        The Refreshing Power of God in Nature The poem celebrates God's constant
        presence and influence in the natural world. Hopkins uses vivid imagery
        to portray this divine energy.

        The First Eight Lines (Octave): The opening line uses a surprising
        metaphor: God's grandeur is like an electric charge ("charged") that
        flows through the world, renewing it. Nature is depicted as constantly
        overflowing with this energy, like oil being pressed from olives
        ("fresh-firecoal from the vein"). A sense of tension and release is
        present, similar to lightning flashing ("like shook foil"). However, the
        speaker acknowledges the human impact on nature. We "foil" or dull God's
        brilliance with our actions.
      </li>

        The Last Six Lines (Sestet): Despite human failings, the world isn't
        utterly spent or ruined. Nature retains its inherent freshness because
        God's presence is constant and everlasting ("And for all this nature is
        never spent"). Even when humanity seems to prevail against nature, God's
        grandeur endures.

        Key Themes: Nature as God's Creation: The poem emphasizes how the
        natural world reflects God's glory and vitality. Human Impact: The
        speaker acknowledges the negative influence humans have on the
        environment. Enduring Divine Presence: Despite human actions, God's
        power remains constant and renews nature. Overall, "God's Grandeur" is a
        testament to the resilience of nature and the ever-present influence of
        the divine.
