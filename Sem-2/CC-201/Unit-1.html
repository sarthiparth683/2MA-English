      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        "Michael: A Pastoral Poem" is a narrative poem by William Wordsworth,
        written in 1798 and published in the 1800 edition of "Lyrical Ballads."
        The poem is one of Wordsworth's most famous works, focusing on rural
        life and the emotional struggles of ordinary people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plot: Michael, a hardworking and honest shepherd, has spent his entire
        life tending to his sheep on his farm, known as "The Evening Star." He
        is deeply connected to the land and the traditions of his ancestors.
        Michael's love for his family and his land is profound, and he takes
        great pride in his work.
      </li>
      <li>
        As Michael and Isabel grow older, they face financial difficulties,
        primarily due to a debt Michael had guaranteed for a relative. To save
        the farm from being lost, Michael decides to send their son, Luke, to
        work in the city. Although this decision is heartbreaking for the
        family, Michael believes it is necessary for their survival.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before Luke departs, Michael takes him to a special spot on their land
        and shows him an unfinished sheepfold (a stone enclosure for sheep) that
        they were building together. Michael asks Luke to finish the work when
        he returns, symbolizing the hope that the son will come back to carry on
        the family's legacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, Luke is seduced by the vices of city life and never returns
        home. The poem ends tragically, with Michael and Isabel dying, and the
        farm being lost. The unfinished sheepfold remains as a poignant reminder
        of the family's broken dreams and the loss of their way of life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes: Rural Life and Tradition: The poem emphasizes the connection
        between people and the land, highlighting the simplicity, beauty, and
        hardships of rural life. Loss and Change: The poem explores the pain of
        loss, both personal and cultural, as the traditional way of life is
        threatened by external forces like economic pressures and urbanization.
        Family and Legacy: Michael's deep love for his son and his desire to
        pass on the family farm to Luke are central to the poem's emotional
        impact.

      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        In the unfinished gothic poem(Horror theme) Christabel by S.T.
        Coleridge, a late night encounter in the woods sets the stage for a
        chilling mystery. The Spark of Intrigue: The poem opens on a dark April
        night with Sir Leoline's loyal dog howling, foreshadowing trouble.
        Christabel, Sir Leoline's innocent daughter, ventures into the woods to
        pray for her betrothed. There, she discovers Geraldine, a beautiful
        woman claiming to be abducted by bandits. Taking Refuge, Finding Fear:
        Filled with compassion, Christabel brings Geraldine back to the castle.
        As they prepare for bed, Christabel notices a strange mark on
        Geraldine's breast, but a mysterious spell prevents her from speaking of
        it. Geraldine's unsettling behavior, including a cold touch and
        mesmerizing eyes, arouses Christabel's suspicion. A Father's Trust, a
        Daughter's Doubt: Sir Leoline warmly welcomes Geraldine, creating
        tension between him and Christabel. Christabel tries to warn her father
        about Geraldine's odd behavior, but the spell renders her helpless.
        Leoline, misinterpreting Christabel's unease as jealousy, becomes angry
        and distrustful of his own daughter. The Unresolved Mystery: The poem
        ends with Sir Leoline turning his back on Christabel and embracing
        Geraldine. The unresolved narrative leaves us hanging: Will Christabel
        break free from the spell? Will Sir Leoline discover Geraldine's true
        nature? Themes at Play: The poem explores the classic battle between
        good and evil, with Christabel representing purity and Geraldine
        embodying darkness. It delves into the deceptive nature of appearances,
        where beauty can mask sinister intentions. The power dynamics between
        the female characters shift as Christabel becomes controlled by
        Geraldine. Christabel, though unfinished, remains a captivating work for
        its suspenseful atmosphere, its gothic elements, and its exploration of
        timeless themes.
