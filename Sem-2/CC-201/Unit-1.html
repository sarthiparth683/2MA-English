      <li>
        "Michael" is an extended ballad, pastoral in nature, dealing with rural
        life and shepherding. A long poem of 491 lines, it appeared at the end
        of Lyrical Ballads. The story involves an aged father, Michael, and his
        younger wife, Isabel. The couple has one son, Luke, whom they raise
        lovingly to take over their property with devotion to the simple ideals
        they have lived by. Their setting is lonely and isolated as they
        concentrate their lives and energies on themselves. The story seems
        familiar as part of the folklore of the area, which as the poet says is,
        "homely and rude," meaning down to earth and unpolished. The story is of
        a man who became a father late in life and the cares he and his somewhat
        younger wife take to form the family bond. They became legendary for the
        great work they expended on their rocky land and their devotion to it.
        Isabel hung a lamp "by the chimney's edge," which became a familiar sign
        in the area. It signaled their uncounted hours of labor, called in the
        poem "a public Symbol of the life the thrifty pair had lived." Their
        homestead was called by all "The Evening Star." Michael, the father,
        gave great attention to the child as a baby and youth, sharing duties
        with his wife, so that Luke grew up with two close parents. Michael and
        Luke often sat by a huge oak called the Clipping Tree and tended the
        sheep. When Luke was old enough, he had to be sent, against all their
        desires, to work in the city to pay off an obligation Michael had
        incurred in good faith. Years before he had to stake his ownership of
        his land because his nephew had run up debts by ill luck, and no one
        else could help. To hold it for Luke, he would have to come up with a
        large sum or have the land seized. The family struggles emotionally with
        the decision to separate, but both parents eventually find peace with
        sending Luke to work in the city for another relative, in the hope he
        can earn enough to settle the legal claim. To comfort them all, Michael
        lays a large rock at the spot where he promises Luke they will together
        build a new sheepfold, or shelter for the sheep, upon his return.
        Nothing will touch the spot in his absence. But after a time Luke falls
        victim to the temptations of city life, loses his direction and family
        devotion, and disappears. Michael and Isabel wait faithfully for their
        son, but their own lives reach their end, and he never returns. Michael
        is comforted by his loyal dog for some years, but he dies at 80, and
        Isabel follows him three years later. In time everything changes around
        their land, The Evening Star cottage is demolished, and they live on
        only in legend. But the stone placed by the father for his son, as well
        as the giant oak tree, remain as reminders they were there at all.

      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        In the unfinished gothic poem(Horror theme) Christabel by S.T.
        Coleridge, a late night encounter in the woods sets the stage for a
        chilling mystery. The Spark of Intrigue: The poem opens on a dark April
        night with Sir Leoline's loyal dog howling, foreshadowing trouble.
        Christabel, Sir Leoline's innocent daughter, ventures into the woods to
        pray for her betrothed. There, she discovers Geraldine, a beautiful
        woman claiming to be abducted by bandits. Taking Refuge, Finding Fear:
        Filled with compassion, Christabel brings Geraldine back to the castle.
        As they prepare for bed, Christabel notices a strange mark on
        Geraldine's breast, but a mysterious spell prevents her from speaking of
        it. Geraldine's unsettling behavior, including a cold touch and
        mesmerizing eyes, arouses Christabel's suspicion. A Father's Trust, a
        Daughter's Doubt: Sir Leoline warmly welcomes Geraldine, creating
        tension between him and Christabel. Christabel tries to warn her father
        about Geraldine's odd behavior, but the spell renders her helpless.
        Leoline, misinterpreting Christabel's unease as jealousy, becomes angry
        and distrustful of his own daughter. The Unresolved Mystery: The poem
        ends with Sir Leoline turning his back on Christabel and embracing
        Geraldine. The unresolved narrative leaves us hanging: Will Christabel
        break free from the spell? Will Sir Leoline discover Geraldine's true
        nature? Themes at Play: The poem explores the classic battle between
        good and evil, with Christabel representing purity and Geraldine
        embodying darkness. It delves into the deceptive nature of appearances,
        where beauty can mask sinister intentions. The power dynamics between
        the female characters shift as Christabel becomes controlled by
        Geraldine. Christabel, though unfinished, remains a captivating work for
        its suspenseful atmosphere, its gothic elements, and its exploration of
        timeless themes.
