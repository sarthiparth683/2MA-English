      <li><b>Summary:-</b></li>
      <li>
        "Michael: A Pastoral Poem" by William Wordsworth tells the tragic story
        of Michael, an old shepherd, and his son Luke. The poem reflects
        Wordsworth's emphasis on nature, rural life, and human emotion. Here's a
        stanza-wise summary:
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 1-3 Wordsworth introduces the setting of the poem, a remote
        valley where Michael, a shepherd, has lived his entire life. The poet
        describes the serene and beautiful landscape, emphasizing the simplicity
        and peace of rural life. The valley, known as "Green-head Ghyll,"
        becomes a symbol of nature's enduring presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 4-5 The poem introduces Michael, an old shepherd who is deeply
        connected to the land. He lives with his wife, Isabel, and their only
        son, Luke. Michael is described as a man of integrity, strength, and
        emotional depth, who loves his land and family. Despite his age, he is
        still strong and hardworking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 6-9 Michael's life is tied to his land, and he takes pride in
        his work as a shepherd. Wordsworth describes the bond between Michael
        and Luke, a young boy who has grown up under his father's guidance.
        Michael dreams of leaving his land and legacy to Luke, teaching him the
        values of hard work, honesty, and a love of nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 10-13 However, Michael faces financial difficulties. To save his
        farm, he is forced to send Luke to the city to work for a merchant
        relative. Michael's decision is filled with sorrow, but he hopes that
        Luke will return to the valley to continue the family legacy. Before
        Luke leaves, Michael takes him to a spot on the farm, where they begin
        to build a sheepfold together—a symbolic gesture of the future they both
        hope for.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 14-17 Luke leaves for the city, and Michael and Isabel are left
        alone. The separation is painful, but they remain hopeful that Luke will
        succeed and return. Michael works on the sheepfold, but as time passes,
        news from Luke becomes less frequent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 18-20 Tragically, Luke succumbs to the temptations of city life
        and loses his moral compass. He commits a crime and brings shame to
        himself and his family. Michael is devastated by the news. The poem
        describes how Michael continues to work on the sheepfold, but it remains
        unfinished, a symbol of his broken hopes and dreams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanzas 21-24 In the final stanzas, Michael’s spirit is crushed by the
        loss of Luke. His deep connection to the land and his family’s legacy is
        forever altered. Wordsworth emphasizes the sorrow and grief that
        accompany Michael's situation. Michael dies with his dream unfulfilled,
        and the sheepfold remains incomplete—a symbol of the family’s
        disintegration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion The poem reflects Wordsworth's themes of nature, human
        emotion, and the struggles of rural life. Michael’s story is one of
        love, loss, and the passage of time, with nature remaining a constant
        presence amid human suffering.

        poem, showcasing the emotional depth and pastoral imagery characteristic
        of Wordsworth’s work.
