      <li><h1>2. S.T. Coleridge: Christabel</h1></li>
      <li>Characters:-</li>
      <li>
        1. Christabel is characterized by her piety, purity, and naivety. She
        prays for her absent lover, suggesting deep faith and devotion. Her
        trusting nature is a key trait, as she welcomes Geraldine into her home
        without suspicion, despite feeling some unexplainable discomfort around
        her. Her passivity and vulnerability are central to her role, as she
        becomes a victim of Geraldine’s manipulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Geraldine (Antagonist) Role: Geraldine is the antagonist in the poem.
        She appears mysteriously in the forest and is taken in by Christabel.
        Geraldine's arrival brings a sense of foreboding and supernatural
        unease, and it becomes clear that she represents a dark, corrupting
        force that contrasts with Christabel's innocence. Characteristics:
        Geraldine is enigmatic and unsettling, with hints of supernatural
        influence. Her physical appearance is beautiful but eerie, and she seems
        to have some kind of hypnotic power over Christabel and others. There is
        a strong implication that Geraldine is not entirely human, and she is
        depicted as manipulative, secretive, and possibly evil. Her motivations
        are ambiguous, but her presence disrupts the peace and purity of
        Christabel’s life, suggesting she symbolizes temptation or malevolent
        influence.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Sir Leoline (Christabel’s Father) Role: Sir Leoline is Christabel’s
        father, a nobleman who loves his daughter dearly. He is a central figure
        in the second part of the poem when he is introduced. His past
        friendship with Lord Roland, Geraldine’s father, plays an important role
        in how he reacts to Geraldine’s presence. Characteristics: Sir Leoline
        is portrayed as a loving and protective father. He is initially
        overjoyed at the appearance of Geraldine because of his old bond with
        her father, but he is also emotionally fragile, having suffered losses
        in his life. His strong emotions may cloud his judgment, as he does not
        see the danger Geraldine poses to his daughter, despite subtle warnings
        from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Lord Roland de Vaux (Geraldine’s Father) Role: Lord Roland is
        Geraldine’s father and a close friend of Sir Leoline, though he does not
        physically appear in the poem. His relationship with Sir Leoline
        influences the latter’s decision to take in Geraldine without question.
        Characteristics: Though Lord Roland doesn’t appear in the poem directly,
        he is described as a noble and honorable man, which stands in contrast
        to the unsettling nature of his daughter, Geraldine. His character is
        important for the trust Sir Leoline places in Geraldine, even though she
        behaves suspiciously.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Bracy the Bard Role: Bracy is a minstrel, or bard, who serves Sir
        Leoline. He is loyal to his lord and plays a minor but important role in
        warning Sir Leoline of a danger that may befall Christabel. His dream
        vision serves as a symbolic warning about Geraldine. Characteristics:
        Bracy is depicted as a wise and perceptive figure. In a dream, he sees a
        dove (symbolizing Christabel) being threatened by a snake (which could
        represent Geraldine). His warning, however, is not fully heeded by Sir
        Leoline. Bracy’s role as a bard links him to the tradition of seers and
        prophetic figures, offering insight into the underlying tensions of the
        poem.

      <li><b>Summary:-</b></li>
      <li>
        "Christabel" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge is a gothic narrative poem, full
        of mystery, supernatural elements, and vivid imagery. It was published
        in two parts (in 1797 and 1800), but was never completed. Here's a
        stanza-wise explanation of the key parts of the poem:
      </li>
      <li>
        Part I Stanza 1–6: The Mysterious Night The poem begins by describing a
        night full of supernatural elements. It’s midnight, and the atmosphere
        is eerie and filled with "horrid" imagery (owls hooting, dogs barking).
        Christabel, the protagonist, goes to the forest to pray for her absent
        lover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 7–12: The Meeting with Geraldine In the forest, Christabel
        encounters a mysterious woman named Geraldine, who claims to have been
        abducted by knights. She is seemingly helpless, so Christabel takes her
        back to her father's castle to offer her shelter. There’s an underlying
        sense of something unnatural about Geraldine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 13–20: Geraldine’s entry into the castle is significant as
        Christabel’s dog barks at her, sensing something evil, but Christabel
        dismisses it. Geraldine’s behavior starts to hint at something sinister,
        but she continues to play the role of the victim. Christabel, full of
        innocence and kindness, is unaware of this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 21–27: The Strange Encounter As Christabel prepares to share her
        bed with Geraldine, she begins to feel a sense of dread. Geraldine
        undresses, and her appearance reveals something monstrous, but Coleridge
        leaves this to the imagination. Geraldine casts a spell over Christabel,
        who becomes mesmerized and helpless, falling into a deep sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 28–33: Geraldine's Spell Geraldine puts Christabel under her
        control. When morning comes, Christabel wakes up confused, feeling
        something terrible has happened, but she cannot recall exactly what.
        Geraldine acts as though nothing is wrong, continuing her manipulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Part II Stanza 1–6: The Return of Sir Leoline Sir Leoline, Christabel’s
        father, is introduced. He is a nobleman grieving over the loss of his
        wife and is extremely protective of Christabel. When he sees Geraldine,
        he is immediately captivated by her beauty and charm, not realizing she
        is dangerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 7–12: Sir Leoline's Reaction Geraldine uses her powers to win
        over Sir Leoline’s trust. He decides to send her back to her father (who
        was once his friend but had a falling out). Sir Leoline’s affection
        toward Geraldine further isolates Christabel, who is becoming
        increasingly distressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 13–17: Christabel’s Instinctive Fear Christabel starts to feel an
        overwhelming fear of Geraldine, but she is unable to explain it. She
        tries to speak up but cannot express her feelings clearly, as the spell
        Geraldine has cast makes her powerless. Sir Leoline dismisses
        Christabel's concerns, blaming them on her imagination.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 18–24: Geraldine’s Triumph Geraldine continues to exert control
        over both Christabel and Sir Leoline. She has a moment of triumph, as
        Sir Leoline prepares to send her back to her father with honor.
        Meanwhile, Christabel remains trapped, unable to break free from
        Geraldine’s supernatural influence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Final Stanzas: Unfinished The poem abruptly ends, leaving the narrative
        unresolved. Coleridge never completed "Christabel," so readers are left
        to speculate about the fate of Christabel, Sir Leoline, and the true
        nature of Geraldine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes and Analysis Innocence vs. Evil: Christabel represents innocence,
        while Geraldine is a figure of corruption and evil. The tension between
        these forces is the driving force of the poem. Supernatural Elements:
        The poem is filled with supernatural occurrences, from Geraldine’s spell
        to the ominous atmosphere of the night. These elements heighten the
        gothic nature of the work. Sexual Undertones: There are subtle hints of
        sexual tension, particularly in the scenes where Geraldine undresses in
        front of Christabel, suggesting a violation of Christabel’s purity.
        Father-Daughter Relationship: Sir Leoline's love for Christabel is
        clouded by his infatuation with Geraldine, showing how easily familial
        bonds can be manipulated by external forces. The unfinished nature of
        the poem adds to its mystique, as readers are left to wonder about
        Geraldine’s true intentions and Christabel’s ultimate fate.
