      <li><h1>John Keats: Ode to a Nightingale.</h1></li> 
      <li>written and published in 1819.</li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        Stanza 1: In the opening stanza, the speaker expresses a feeling of
        overwhelming sadness. He feels as though he has drunk hemlock or some
        other poisonous drink that causes numbness. This is not because he
        envies the nightingale, but because its singing fills him with such
        melancholy that it seems too beautiful for the world. The speaker feels
        weighed down by the heaviness of his emotions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 2: Here, the speaker wishes for wine to transport him away from
        the worries of the world. He imagines that drinking will allow him to
        escape to the world of the nightingale, free from the painful realities
        of life. He longs for an idyllic, carefree existence where he can be as
        joyous as the bird, free from earthly concerns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 3: The speaker reflects on the suffering of human life: aging,
        sickness, and the inevitable death that everyone must face. He contrasts
        this harsh reality with the timeless song of the nightingale, which
        seems to live outside of the bounds of time. He wishes he could escape
        this suffering and join the nightingale in its eternal, carefree
        existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4: In this stanza, the speaker imagines escaping not through wine
        but through poetry. He believes poetry can lift him to the nightingale's
        world, where he can forget the sorrows of human life. The darkness of
        the physical world does not bother him, as he feels carried away by the
        beauty and music of the nightingale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 5: The speaker describes the natural world as a beautiful,
        mysterious place. He focuses on the sensual experience of being
        surrounded by flowers and the night air, though he cannot see them in
        the darkness. He seems to find comfort in the natural world, which is
        filled with the same beauty and vitality as the nightingale's song.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 6: Here, the speaker contemplates death and seems to embrace the
        idea of dying peacefully while listening to the nightingale's song. He
        imagines that passing away in such a state would be painless and serene,
        with the bird's eternal music continuing on, even after his death.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 7: The speaker reflects on the immortality of the nightingale's
        song. The bird has sung for centuries, bringing joy to various
        generations, from ancient kings to simple people. Its song transcends
        time, remaining constant, while human lives are transient. This eternal
        quality of the nightingale contrasts with the brevity of human
        existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 8: In the final stanza, the speaker is pulled back to reality.
        The nightingale's song fades, leaving him uncertain about whether his
        experience was real or just a dream. The moment of transcendence is
        over, and he is left to ponder whether the beautiful escape provided by
        the bird's song was just an illusion. He ends by questioning whether he
        has been truly awake or dreaming.
