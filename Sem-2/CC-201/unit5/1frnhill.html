        <b> Summary:- </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 1: The speaker reflects on the carefree and innocent days of his
        childhood when he lived on a farm (Fern Hill). He describes how he was
        full of joy, feeling young and connected to nature. The vibrant imagery
        of green fields and the sun suggests a sense of harmony and
        timelessness. He personifies time as something that allowed him freedom,
        where he was "prince of the apple towns"—a metaphor for the playful and
        imaginative world of youth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 2: This stanza continues the theme of innocence and freedom, as
        the speaker recalls running around the farm, unburdened by worries. He
        uses language associated with pastoral beauty, referencing birds and
        animals. The landscape seems enchanted, and time is still seen as a
        friendly presence. The speaker's connection to the natural world is
        strong, and there is a sense of being in sync with the rhythms of
        nature, unaware of the passage of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 3: Here, the speaker begins to hint at the passage of time,
        although he still seems unaware of it during his childhood. The images
        of light and movement—such as the farm waking up and the skies being
        filled with birds—suggest the continuity of life. The speaker’s joy in
        his youthful surroundings is evident, but there is an underlying
        suggestion that this innocence is not permanent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 4: In this stanza, the imagery becomes more reflective and
        symbolic. The speaker recalls his childhood as if it were a kind of
        Eden, a perfect paradise before the knowledge of adulthood. The "simple
        stars" and "spells of sand" evoke a magical sense of time, but there is
        also the suggestion that time is inevitable and always present. The
        speaker now seems to understand that time was always there, watching him
        even in his moments of carefree joy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 5: The tone begins to shift as the speaker recognizes the reality
        of time. He acknowledges that while he was young, time was still
        passing, and this realization brings a sense of loss. He uses the
        metaphor of time as both kind and cruel—allowing him the freedom to
        enjoy his youth but also quietly guiding him toward adulthood and the
        loss of innocence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stanza 6: The poem concludes with the speaker reflecting on the
        inevitability of time. He is no longer in the paradise of his childhood;
        the carefree days of youth have passed. Time, once a friend, has become
        a force that leads to change, aging, and ultimately death. The speaker
        recognizes that, despite the joy and beauty of his youth, time has
        always been in control. The imagery of "dying" and "chains" suggests
        that the speaker feels trapped by time, but the poem still holds a
        reverence for the beauty of life.
      </li>

        Overall Themes: Fern Hill explores themes of innocence, the passage of
        time, and the inevitable loss of youth. The poem is nostalgic and
        reflects on the fleeting nature of childhood. The speaker’s shifting
        understanding of time—from a friendly, carefree force to something that
        constrains and ages—is central to the poem's emotional impact. The
        pastoral imagery and rich, lyrical language capture the beauty and
        transience of life.
