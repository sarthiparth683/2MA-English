      <li><h1>W.H. Auden: The Unknown Citizen</h1></li>
      <li>Published in 1940</li>

        The first stanza introduces the "Unknown Citizen," a nameless, faceless man identified only by a bureaucratic code. He is described as a perfect example
        of an ordinary, compliant individual. He followed societal norms, worked diligently at a factory, and maintained a good relationship with his employer
        and union. The Bureau of Statistics finds no fault in his behavior, and social psychologists deem him likable. His habits, such as reading the newspaper
        and reacting predictably to advertisements, are seen as markers of his conformity.

        The second stanza provides further details about the citizen's life, emphasizing his adherence to societal expectations. He was financially secure,
        insured, and owned all the "modern" conveniences of his time. His political and social opinions were conventional, shifting in alignment with societal
        trends. He fulfilled his role as a family man and never questioned or disrupted societal systems, such as education. This paints him as a perfectly
        conforming individual who did nothing extraordinary to stand out but also nothing wrong to be criticized.

        The concluding lines highlight the poem's satirical tone. The bureaucratic system, so focused on measurable statistics, cannot determine whether the
        Unknown Citizen was truly free or happy. These human qualities are deemed irrelevant or absurd by the state because they cannot be quantified. The poem
        critiques modern society's obsession with conformity and its disregard for individuality and emotional well-being.
