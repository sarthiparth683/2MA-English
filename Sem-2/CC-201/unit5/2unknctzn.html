      <li>
        W.H. Auden's poem "The Unknown Citizen" takes the form of a eulogy for a
        deceased citizen, but with a twist. It's not a heartfelt tribute, but
        rather a cold, clinical report, likely generated by a future government
        agency.

      <li>
        The poem details the life of this unknown citizen entirely through
        statistics and records. We learn about his voting record, consumption
        habits, family life, and even his leisure activities. However, none of
        these details reveal anything about the man himself, his thoughts,
        feelings, or individuality.

        The speaker, the government agency, portrays the unknown citizen as the
        ideal model. He consumed the right products, followed the rules, and
        caused no trouble. There's a dark irony here. While the report
        celebrates his conformity, it also highlights the complete lack of
        individuality and freedom.

        The poem's final lines are particularly striking. The speaker ponders
        whether the unknown citizen was "free" or "happy," but then dismisses
        these questions. The bureaucratic system the poem represents cannot
        comprehend such subjective concepts.
      </li>

        "The Unknown Citizen" is a satire that criticizes the dangers of
        excessive conformity and government control. It warns against a future
        where people are reduced to mere statistics, valued only for their
        obedience and contribution to a soulless society.
