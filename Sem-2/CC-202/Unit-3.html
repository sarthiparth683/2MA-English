      <li>Summary of "The Alchemist" by Ben Jonson</li>
      <li>
        Act 1: The play opens with a conman, Subtle, and his partners Face and
        Dol Common, preparing for a day of swindling. They take advantage of the
        absence of Face’s master, Lovewit, who has left his house due to the
        plague. The trio plans to deceive a series of gullible characters by
        pretending to be alchemists and magicians who can offer wealth,
        knowledge, and power. Their main con is centered around the false
        promise of turning base metals into gold.

        Act 2: The first victims begin to appear. Dapper, a clerk, wants a charm
        to help him win at gambling. Subtle and his team convince him that he is
        related to the Queen of the Fairies and needs a special preparation.
        Meanwhile, Abel Drugger, a tobacconist, seeks advice on how to arrange
        his shop for maximum profit, and Subtle offers fake astrological advice.
        Sir Epicure Mammon, a wealthy and greedy man, is introduced, and he
        believes Subtle can actually create the philosopher’s stone to make him
        endlessly rich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Subtle and Face continue deceiving their clients. Mammon is shown
        false evidence of alchemical work, making him more hopeful. Meanwhile,
        Surly, a skeptical friend of Mammon, begins to suspect that Subtle,
        Face, and Dol are con artists. Another victim, Ananias, a religious
        fanatic, appears to demand gold on behalf of his sect, believing that
        the alchemists can create it for the greater good.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: The cons become increasingly complicated. Mammon is still
        expecting the philosopher’s stone, while Surly, who is now disguised as
        a Spanish nobleman, plans to expose Subtle and Face. Meanwhile, Dapper
        and Drugger are strung along with ridiculous promises. Subtle and Face
        start to worry about their schemes unraveling as the situation becomes
        more chaotic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5: The chaos comes to a head when Lovewit returns unexpectedly to
        his home. Face quickly changes his identity back to his servant role and
        convinces Lovewit to let him handle the situation. Lovewit ends up
        profiting from the situation, taking over some of the cons' spoils. The
        deceived characters are humiliated, and Face, Subtle, and Dol are
        exposed. Subtle and Dol flee, leaving Face (now back to his real
        identity, Jeremy) to smooth things over with Lovewit, who forgives him.
        In the end, the gullible characters leave, disappointed, and Lovewit
        marries one of the dupes, winning back his property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: The play is a sharp satire on greed, gullibility, and the
        consequences of deception. It critiques those who are willing to believe
        in get-rich-quick schemes and the manipulation of people's desires by
        fraudsters.
