        Here is a description of the major characters from "The Alchemist" by
        Ben Jonson, detailing their roles and characteristics: 1. Lovewit Role:
        Lovewit is the master of the house where the plot unfolds. He has left
        his home during a plague and returns unexpectedly at the end.
        Characteristics: A clever and opportunistic figure, Lovewit is portrayed
        as someone who ultimately benefits from the schemes his servant has been
        running in his absence. He is pragmatic, choosing to forgive his servant
        in exchange for personal gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Jeremy/Face Role: Jeremy is Lovewit’s servant. While Lovewit is away,
        he assumes the alias Face and runs a series of cons with Subtle and Dol
        Common. He is the key instigator in recruiting and managing the
        “customers” of the various schemes. Characteristics: Face is cunning,
        resourceful, and a master manipulator. He can switch between
        personalities depending on whom he is trying to deceive, making him
        highly adaptable in the different fraudulent activities they carry out.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Subtle Role: Subtle is a conman who claims to be an alchemist. He
        partners with Face to swindle people by promising them wealth, love
        potions, and secret knowledge. Characteristics: Subtle is highly
        intelligent, quick-witted, and persuasive, but also greedy and
        treacherous. His knowledge of alchemy (though fraudulent) gives him an
        air of authority, allowing him to deceive the gullible customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Dol Common Role: Dol is a prostitute and the third partner in the con
        scheme. She takes on various roles to assist in deceiving the clients,
        such as posing as a noblewoman or mystical figure. Characteristics: Dol
        is sharp, confident, and plays a central role in manipulating the
        customers through her charm and deception. She is crucial in keeping the
        schemes running smoothly, though her temper sometimes flares when things
        go wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Dapper Role: Dapper is a gullible clerk and the first customer of the
        trio. He comes to them seeking a way to win at gambling, and they
        convince him that a spirit or “familiar” can help him. Characteristics:
        Dapper is naive and easily manipulated. His desire for wealth blinds him
        to the ridiculousness of the scheme, and he’s willing to go to absurd
        lengths (like being gagged and tied up) in pursuit of his goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Abel Drugger Role: Abel Drugger is a young, ambitious tobacconist and
        the second customer. He seeks Subtle’s advice to ensure the success of
        his business. Characteristics: Drugger is simple and superstitious. He
        believes Subtle’s fraudulent advice on the proper way to arrange his
        shop will lead to prosperity. His innocence makes him an easy target for
        the cons.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Sir Epicure Mammon Role: Mammon is a wealthy and hedonistic man, the
        third customer. He comes to Subtle seeking the Philosopher’s Stone,
        which he believes will grant him untold riches and allow him to indulge
        in every possible pleasure. Characteristics: Mammon is materialistic,
        greedy, and obsessed with luxury. His speeches reveal his extravagant
        dreams of wealth and indulgence. He is also gullible, easily swayed by
        Subtle’s promises of grandeur.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Surly Role: Surly is a skeptic and a friend of Mammon. He suspects
        that Subtle and Face are con artists and tries to expose their schemes.
        Characteristics: Surly is intelligent, cynical, and distrustful. Unlike
        the other customers, he is not easily fooled and sees through the
        deceptions. He even disguises himself as a Spaniard to infiltrate the
        group and reveal the truth, but his plans are foiled.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. Ananias Role: Ananias is a Puritan and one of the Anabaptists, a
        religious sect. He comes to Subtle and Face to request their help in
        coining money, a highly illegal activity. Characteristics: Ananias is
        self-righteous, hypocritical, and fanatical about his religious beliefs.
        He is used by Jonson to satirize the Puritans, portraying them as greedy
        and hypocritical despite their claims to piety.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Tribulation Wholesome Role: Tribulation is another member of the
        Anabaptists, and he accompanies Ananias in their dealings with Subtle.
        Characteristics: Like Ananias, Tribulation is a hypocritical Puritan,
        willing to engage in illegal activities like counterfeiting despite his
        religious principles. He is more diplomatic than Ananias but still
        driven by greed.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Dame Pliant Role: Dame Pliant is a young widow and Kastrill’s
        sister. She becomes the target of both Subtle and Face, who each want to
        marry her for her money. Characteristics: Dame Pliant is attractive but
        naive, allowing others to control and manipulate her. She is a passive
        character, easily swayed by the stronger personalities around her,
        including her brother and the two conmen.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Kastrill Role: Kastrill is a quarrelsome young man and Dame Pliant’s
        brother. He comes to Subtle and Face to learn the art of quarrelling, as
        he believes it will give him status. Characteristics: Kastrill is
        foolish, hot-tempered, and obsessed with his social standing. He is
        comically naive, believing that learning to argue will somehow elevate
        his position in society. Despite his bluster, he is easily manipulated
        by the conmen. These characters collectively illustrate themes of greed,
        gullibility, and social satire, with each being caught in or
        contributing to the farcical schemes run by Face, Subtle, and Dol.

      <li><b>Summary:-</b></li>
      <li>
        Act 1: The play opens with a conman, Subtle, and his partners Face and
        Dol Common, preparing for a day of swindling. They take advantage of the
        absence of Face’s master, Lovewit, who has left his house due to the
        plague. The trio plans to deceive a series of gullible characters by
        pretending to be alchemists and magicians who can offer wealth,
        knowledge, and power. Their main con is centered around the false
        promise of turning base metals into gold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: The first victims begin to appear. Dapper, a clerk, wants a charm
        to help him win at gambling. Subtle and his team convince him that he is
        related to the Queen of the Fairies and needs a special preparation.
        Meanwhile, Abel Drugger, a tobacconist, seeks advice on how to arrange
        his shop for maximum profit, and Subtle offers fake astrological advice.
        Sir Epicure Mammon, a wealthy and greedy man, is introduced, and he
        believes Subtle can actually create the philosopher’s stone to make him
        endlessly rich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Subtle and Face continue deceiving their clients. Mammon is shown
        false evidence of alchemical work, making him more hopeful. Meanwhile,
        Surly, a skeptical friend of Mammon, begins to suspect that Subtle,
        Face, and Dol are con artists. Another victim, Ananias, a religious
        fanatic, appears to demand gold on behalf of his sect, believing that
        the alchemists can create it for the greater good.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: The cons become increasingly complicated. Mammon is still
        expecting the philosopher’s stone, while Surly, who is now disguised as
        a Spanish nobleman, plans to expose Subtle and Face. Meanwhile, Dapper
        and Drugger are strung along with ridiculous promises. Subtle and Face
        start to worry about their schemes unraveling as the situation becomes
        more chaotic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5: The chaos comes to a head when Lovewit returns unexpectedly to
        his home. Face quickly changes his identity back to his servant role and
        convinces Lovewit to let him handle the situation. Lovewit ends up
        profiting from the situation, taking over some of the cons' spoils. The
        deceived characters are humiliated, and Face, Subtle, and Dol are
        exposed. Subtle and Dol flee, leaving Face (now back to his real
        identity, Jeremy) to smooth things over with Lovewit, who forgives him.
        In the end, the gullible characters leave, disappointed, and Lovewit
        marries one of the dupes, winning back his property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conclusion: The play is a sharp satire on greed, gullibility, and the
        consequences of deception. It critiques those who are willing to believe
        in get-rich-quick schemes and the manipulation of people's desires by
        fraudsters.
