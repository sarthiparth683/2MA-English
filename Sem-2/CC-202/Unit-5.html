      <li>
        "All for Love" by John Dryden is a heroic drama that retells the story of Antony and Cleopatra, focusing on their tragic love and loyalty. It was
        written in 1677 and is structured in five acts, which I'll summarize below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1: The play opens in Alexandria, where Antony, after losing the Battle of Actium, is in a state of despair. Ventidius, a loyal friend and Roman
        general, arrives to remind Antony of his past glories and urges him to leave Cleopatra and return to Rome to regain his honor. Ventidius despises
        Cleopatra, believing she has weakened Antony. Although Antony is moved by Ventidius' arguments, he remains deeply in love with Cleopatra and is torn
        between his duties and his passion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2: Cleopatra is worried about losing Antony's affection. She confronts him, and their love is rekindled, despite Antony's inner turmoil. Cleopatra
        attempts to manipulate Antony by reminding him of their love and shared experiences. Meanwhile, Octavia, Antony's Roman wife, arrives in Alexandria with
        their two children, seeking to reconcile with Antony and bring him back to Rome. Octavia's presence complicates matters as Antony is forced to confront
        the conflict between his duty as a Roman and his love for Cleopatra.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3: Octavia meets with Cleopatra, leading to a tense exchange. Cleopatra initially appears proud and defiant, but Octavia's dignity and appeal to
        Antony's sense of duty make Cleopatra feel insecure. Antony, caught between the two women, is deeply conflicted. Octavia makes a strong case for Antony
        to return to Rome for the sake of their children and his honor. Despite his emotional struggle, Antony decides to stay with Cleopatra, which leads to
        Ventidius' frustration and disappointment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4: The tension heightens as Antony realizes that his situation is becoming increasingly hopeless. Ventidius, out of loyalty, offers to lead Antony's
        troops in one last battle against Caesar, but Antony refuses, stating that his heart is no longer in the fight. Meanwhile, Cleopatra considers
        abandoning Antony to save herself but ultimately decides to stay by his side. The couple reaffirms their love for each other, accepting their fate.
        Antony's realization of his impending doom leads to a sense of tragic inevitability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5: The final act brings the tragic conclusion. Antony receives false news that Cleopatra has died, leading him to attempt suicide. Mortally wounded,
        Antony is brought to Cleopatra, who is alive and devastated by the turn of events. They share a final, poignant moment before Antony dies in Cleopatra's
        arms. Overcome by grief and guilt, Cleopatra decides to follow Antony in death rather than submit to Caesar. She arranges for a deadly asp to be brought
        to her and, after a final speech, kills herself, joining Antony in death. The play ends with their deaths, emphasizing the themes of love, loyalty, and
        the tragic consequences of their choices.

      <li><b> Summary:- </b></li>
      <li>
        "She Stoops to Conquer" is a comedy play by Oliver Goldsmith, first performed in 1773. The play is a classic example of 18th-century English comedy and
        is known for its humor, mistaken identities, and critique of social pretensions. Below is an act-wise summary of the play:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act I The play opens in the Hardcastle household. Mr. Hardcastle has arranged for his daughter, Kate, to meet Charles Marlow, the son of his old friend,
        in hopes of them marrying. Marlow, however, is known for being nervous around upper-class women but very confident around women of lower status.
        Meanwhile, Tony Lumpkin, Mrs. Hardcastle’s son from a previous marriage, plays a trick on Marlow and his friend George Hastings by convincing them that
        the Hardcastle home is an inn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act II Marlow and Hastings arrive at the Hardcastle home, believing it to be an inn. They behave rudely, treating Mr. Hardcastle as the innkeeper. Mr.
        Hardcastle is shocked by their behavior but assumes they are just brash young men. Meanwhile, Hastings, who is secretly in love with Constance Neville
        (Mrs. Hardcastle’s ward), learns that she lives at the Hardcastle estate. Hastings and Constance plot to elope, but Constance is reluctant because she
        is waiting for her inheritance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act III Kate learns about Marlow’s shyness around women of his own class and decides to disguise herself as a barmaid to observe him more closely.
        Marlow is immediately taken with her in this guise, demonstrating the confidence he lacks with upper-class women. At the same time, Tony plots to help
        Hastings and Constance escape with her inheritance jewels. Mrs. Hardcastle, however, intends to marry Constance to Tony, unaware that Tony has no
        interest in her.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act IV Kate, still in disguise, continues to interact with Marlow, who grows more enamored with her. Mr. Hardcastle becomes increasingly frustrated with
        Marlow’s behavior, but Kate convinces him to give her more time to win Marlow’s affection. Meanwhile, Tony deceives his mother into thinking they have
        lost their way while driving to Aunt Pedigree’s house, allowing Hastings and Constance time to escape. However, the plan fails, and they return home.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act V The truth begins to unravel. Marlow finally learns that the house is not an inn and that Kate is not a barmaid but a gentlewoman of his own class.
        Despite his earlier behavior, Marlow is genuinely in love with Kate. Tony also reveals that he is of age, meaning he is not bound to marry Constance,
        freeing her to marry Hastings. The play ends with the happy union of Kate and Marlow, as well as Hastings and Constance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes: Mistaken Identity: The play revolves around misunderstandings and mistaken identities, leading to comedic situations. Class and Social
        Expectations: Goldsmith critiques the social norms of his time, particularly the rigid class distinctions. Love and Courtship: The play explores
        different aspects of love, from arranged marriages to romantic pursuits. Tone: The play is light-hearted and humorous, with a satirical edge aimed at
        societal norms.
