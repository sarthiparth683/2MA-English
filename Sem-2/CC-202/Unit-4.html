      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>
        Here’s a summary of John Webster’s "The Duchess of Malfi" act by act:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1 The play opens in the court of the Duke of Malfi. The Duchess, a
        young widow, lives with her two corrupt brothers: Ferdinand and the
        Cardinal. They are both highly protective and prohibit her from
        remarrying, fearing that a new marriage would diminish their control
        over her wealth. Despite this, the Duchess secretly falls in love with
        her steward, Antonio. Against her brothers' wishes, she privately
        marries Antonio, swearing him to secrecy. Bosola, a spy employed by
        Ferdinand, is placed in the Duchess's household to keep an eye on her
        actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2 Time has passed, and the Duchess has had a child with Antonio,
        though they continue to keep their marriage a secret. Bosola grows
        suspicious of the Duchess when he notices her behavior during pregnancy.
        He eventually discovers the truth and sends a letter to Ferdinand
        informing him that the Duchess has given birth. Ferdinand, enraged by
        the news, begins plotting revenge against her.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3 Ferdinand confronts the Duchess and accuses her of dishonoring
        their family by secretly marrying beneath her social rank. He threatens
        her, but she bravely defends her actions. The Duchess and Antonio decide
        to flee with their children, but Antonio is sent away for his safety.
        The Duchess, however, is captured by Ferdinand and Bosola. Ferdinand’s
        rage intensifies as he loses control over the situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4 The Duchess is imprisoned in her own palace by Ferdinand, who
        subjects her to cruel psychological torture. He sends her wax figures of
        her dead husband and children, leading her to believe they have been
        murdered. Despite this torment, the Duchess remains strong and refuses
        to submit to her brothers' cruelty. Eventually, Ferdinand orders Bosola
        to strangle the Duchess. Bosola hesitates but ultimately follows through
        with the command. The Duchess is murdered, but her dignity and courage
        remain intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5 Following the Duchess's death, Bosola regrets his actions and
        turns against Ferdinand and the Cardinal. Antonio, unaware of his wife's
        death, seeks reconciliation with the brothers. However, a series of
        tragic events ensue. The Cardinal murders his mistress, Julia, out of
        fear that she might expose his secrets. Bosola, seeking justice,
        accidentally kills Antonio in the process of trying to kill the
        Cardinal. In the final scene, Ferdinand, the Cardinal, and Bosola all
        die in a bloody confrontation, leaving the Duchess’s eldest son as the
        sole survivor to inherit the Malfi estate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The play is a grim exploration of corruption, power, and the
        consequences of unchecked ambition. The Duchess’s tragic end is a result
        of the malicious and tyrannical forces that surround her, but her
        bravery and virtue remain intact throughout her suffering.
