      <li>
        Act 1 The play opens in the court of Malfi, where the recently widowed
        Duchess lives with her brothers, Ferdinand and the Cardinal. Ferdinand
        and the Cardinal are highly controlling and want to prevent their sister
        from remarrying to maintain control over her wealth. Despite their
        warnings, the Duchess secretly marries Antonio, her steward, and they
        have three children.

        Act 2 The Duchess's secret marriage is soon discovered by her brothers.
        They hire Bosola, a malcontent and former convict, to spy on her. Bosola
        discovers the Duchess's pregnancy and informs Ferdinand.

        Act 3 Ferdinand confronts the Duchess, revealing he knows about her
        children. He imprisons her and her children in her own palace. Bosola,
        initially complicit, begins to feel remorse for his actions.

        Act 4 The Duchess is subjected to psychological torture by Ferdinand,
        who presents her with wax figures of her dead family to drive her to
        despair. Ultimately, Bosola is ordered to kill the Duchess and her
        children. He reluctantly complies, but his guilt grows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5 Antonio, unaware of his family's fate, attempts to reconcile with
        Ferdinand. Ferdinand, driven mad by guilt and lycanthropy, accidentally
        kills his own servant. Bosola, filled with remorse, seeks revenge on
        Ferdinand and the Cardinal. A series of misunderstandings and fatal
        encounters lead to the deaths of Antonio, the Cardinal, Ferdinand, and
        Bosola.

        Themes: Power and Corruption: The play explores the corrupting influence
        of power, particularly in the actions of Ferdinand and the Cardinal.
        Fate and Free Will: The characters struggle with their destinies, often
        making choices that lead to their tragic ends. Class and Social
        Structure: The marriage between the Duchess and Antonio challenges the
        rigid social hierarchies of the time. "The Duchess of Malfi" is known
        for its dark themes, complex characters, and poetic language, making it
        a classic example of Jacobean tragedy.
