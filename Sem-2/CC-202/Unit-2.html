      <li>SUMMARY:-</li>
      <li>
        "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare is one of his most renowned tragedies,
        focusing on the complex character of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Here's a
        summary of the play:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1 The play opens with the appearance of the ghost of King Hamlet,
        the recently deceased King of Denmark. The ghost reveals to Prince
        Hamlet, his son, that he was murdered by his own brother Claudius, who
        has now taken the throne and married Hamlet's mother, Gertrude. The
        ghost demands that Hamlet avenge his murder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2 Hamlet begins to act erratically, raising concerns in the court
        about his mental state. Polonius, the chief advisor to the king,
        believes Hamlet's madness stems from his love for Polonius's daughter,
        Ophelia. Claudius and Gertrude try to understand the cause of Hamlet's
        behavior, enlisting the help of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet’s
        old friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3 Hamlet stages a play, "The Mousetrap," which mirrors the events of
        his father’s murder, to gauge Claudius’s guilt. Claudius’s reaction to
        the play confirms his guilt to Hamlet. Gertrude confronts Hamlet about
        his behavior, leading to a heated argument during which Hamlet
        accidentally kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius spying on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4 Claudius, fearing for his life, sends Hamlet to England with
        Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, carrying orders for Hamlet to be executed.
        Meanwhile, Ophelia, distraught over her father’s death, drowns. Her
        brother Laertes returns to Denmark, seeking revenge for Polonius's
        death. Claudius manipulates Laertes into a plot to kill Hamlet using a
        poisoned sword.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5 Hamlet returns to Denmark after escaping the execution plot. He
        confronts Laertes at Ophelia’s funeral, and they grapple in her grave.
        In the final scene, a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes is
        arranged. Both are wounded by the poisoned sword, and Gertrude
        accidentally drinks poisoned wine intended for Hamlet. Laertes, dying,
        reveals Claudius’s plot. Hamlet kills Claudius before succumbing to the
        poison himself. As the royal family lies dead, Fortinbras of Norway
        arrives to find the Danish court in chaos and claims the throne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes "Hamlet" explores themes such as revenge, madness, mortality, and
        the complexity of action. Hamlet's internal struggles and philosophical
        musings on life and death are central to the play, making it a rich text
        for analysis and interpretation.
