      <li><b>CHARACTERS:- </b></li>
      <li>
        Hamlet (Prince of Denmark): Role: The tragic hero of the play, Hamlet is
        the Prince of Denmark, deeply affected by his father’s sudden death and
        his mother’s quick remarriage to his uncle Claudius. Characteristics:
        Hamlet is introspective, philosophical, and struggles with indecision.
        His intellect and wit make him reflective, yet his inability to act
        quickly causes internal conflict. He seeks revenge for his father's
        murder, but grapples with morality, life, death, and the consequences of
        his actions. His famous soliloquy “To be or not to be” reflects his
        existential dilemmas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Claudius (King of Denmark): Role: Hamlet’s uncle and the antagonist of
        the play. Claudius has usurped the throne by killing Hamlet's father and
        marrying Queen Gertrude. Characteristics: Claudius is manipulative,
        ambitious, and deceitful. He is a skilled politician and ruler, but his
        guilt over his crime haunts him. Though capable of remorse, he
        ultimately prioritizes power over morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gertrude (Queen of Denmark): Role: Hamlet’s mother and widow of King
        Hamlet, now married to Claudius. Characteristics: Gertrude is often seen
        as morally weak or passive. Her quick marriage to Claudius after her
        husband's death causes Hamlet great distress. While she loves her son,
        her decisions raise questions about her loyalty. She seems oblivious to
        Claudius’s treachery and often seeks peace and comfort over conflict.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ghost of King Hamlet: Role: The spirit of Hamlet's deceased father who
        reveals the truth of his murder to Hamlet, urging him to seek revenge.
        Characteristics: The Ghost is solemn and commands Hamlet to avenge his
        death. He embodies the themes of uncertainty and the supernatural, and
        his appearance prompts Hamlet’s quest for justice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Polonius (Chamberlain): Role: The chief counselor to King Claudius, and
        father to Ophelia and Laertes. Characteristics: Polonius is a verbose
        and meddling character, often offering advice full of clichés. He is
        somewhat self-important and obsessed with controlling others,
        particularly his children. His spying on Hamlet and meddling in royal
        affairs ultimately leads to his accidental death at Hamlet's hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ophelia (Daughter of Polonius): Role: Polonius's daughter and Hamlet's
        love interest. Characteristics: Ophelia is portrayed as gentle,
        obedient, and vulnerable. She follows the orders of her father and
        brother, and her relationship with Hamlet is complicated by the power
        dynamics in the court. Hamlet's rejection and Polonius’s death drive her
        to madness, eventually leading to her tragic drowning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Laertes (Son of Polonius): Role: Polonius's son, who seeks revenge on
        Hamlet for his father’s death. Characteristics: Laertes is passionate
        and impulsive, driven by loyalty to his family. Unlike Hamlet, he does
        not hesitate in his quest for vengeance. His fiery temper and
        willingness to be manipulated by Claudius contrast with Hamlet’s
        introspective nature, making him a foil to Hamlet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Horatio (Loyal Friend to Hamlet): Role: Hamlet’s closest friend and
        confidante throughout the play. Characteristics: Horatio is
        level-headed, rational, and loyal. He serves as a grounding force for
        Hamlet and is one of the few characters Hamlet fully trusts. Horatio
        remains by Hamlet’s side until the end, tasked with telling Hamlet's
        story after his death.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Friends of Hamlet): Role: Former school
        friends of Hamlet, who are summoned by Claudius to spy on Hamlet.
        Characteristics: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are easily manipulated by
        Claudius and serve as pawns in the king's schemes. They appear friendly,
        but their betrayal of Hamlet leads to their eventual deaths. Their roles
        highlight themes of loyalty, friendship, and manipulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fortinbras (Prince of Norway): Role: The Prince of Norway, seeking to
        avenge his father’s death, which was caused by Hamlet’s father.
        Characteristics: Fortinbras is decisive, courageous, and driven by a
        sense of honor. He is a parallel to Hamlet, as both seek revenge for
        their fathers. However, unlike Hamlet, Fortinbras acts with resolve. By
        the end of the play, Fortinbras arrives in Denmark and claims the
        throne, symbolizing a restoration of order.
      </li>
      <li><b> SUMMARY:- </b></li>
      <li>
        "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare is one of his most renowned tragedies,
        focusing on the complex character of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Here's a
        summary of the play:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1 The play opens with the appearance of the ghost of King Hamlet,
        the recently deceased King of Denmark. The ghost reveals to Prince
        Hamlet, his son, that he was murdered by his own brother Claudius, who
        has now taken the throne and married Hamlet's mother, Gertrude. The
        ghost demands that Hamlet avenge his murder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2 Hamlet begins to act erratically, raising concerns in the court
        about his mental state. Polonius, the chief advisor to the king,
        believes Hamlet's madness stems from his love for Polonius's daughter,
        Ophelia. Claudius and Gertrude try to understand the cause of Hamlet's
        behavior, enlisting the help of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet’s
        old friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3 Hamlet stages a play, "The Mousetrap," which mirrors the events of
        his father’s murder, to gauge Claudius’s guilt. Claudius’s reaction to
        the play confirms his guilt to Hamlet. Gertrude confronts Hamlet about
        his behavior, leading to a heated argument during which Hamlet
        accidentally kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius spying on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4 Claudius, fearing for his life, sends Hamlet to England with
        Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, carrying orders for Hamlet to be executed.
        Meanwhile, Ophelia, distraught over her father’s death, drowns. Her
        brother Laertes returns to Denmark, seeking revenge for Polonius's
        death. Claudius manipulates Laertes into a plot to kill Hamlet using a
        poisoned sword.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5 Hamlet returns to Denmark after escaping the execution plot. He
        confronts Laertes at Ophelia’s funeral, and they grapple in her grave.
        In the final scene, a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes is
        arranged. Both are wounded by the poisoned sword, and Gertrude
        accidentally drinks poisoned wine intended for Hamlet. Laertes, dying,
        reveals Claudius’s plot. Hamlet kills Claudius before succumbing to the
        poison himself. As the royal family lies dead, Fortinbras of Norway
        arrives to find the Danish court in chaos and claims the throne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes "Hamlet" explores themes such as revenge, madness, mortality, and
        the complexity of action. Hamlet's internal struggles and philosophical
        musings on life and death are central to the play, making it a rich text
        for analysis and interpretation.

        Rosalind is Duke Senior's daughter, who has been exiled. When her uncle,

        Characteristics: Rosalind is witty, intelligent, and resourceful. She is
        known for her sharp sense of humor and keen insight into human behavior.
        In her disguise as Ganymede, she navigates complex relationships,

        her to explore gender roles and challenge societal expectations.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Celia (Aliena) Role: Celia is Rosalind's cousin and the daughter of

        devoted to Rosalind. Despite being more reserved than Rosalind, she
        shows great courage and friendship. She has a deep bond with Rosalind,
        and her decision to leave her privileged life behind demonstrates her
        love for her cousin.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Touchstone Role: The court jester who accompanies Rosalind and Celia
        to the Forest of Arden. He provides comic relief in the play with his
        wit and absurdity, while also engaging in philosophical conversations
        with other characters. Characteristics: Touchstone is a clown, but his
        humor often reveals deeper truths about life and society. He is clever,
        sarcastic, and enjoys pointing out the follies of others. Despite his
        crude jokes, he is insightful in his observations of human nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Orlando Role: The romantic hero of the play and the younger brother
        of Oliver. Orlando falls in love with Rosalind at first sight and later

        to the Forest of Arden when he fears for his life. Characteristics:
        Orlando is brave, loyal, and virtuous, though he is somewhat naive in
        matters of love. He is portrayed as noble and strong, yet he lacks
        confidence early in the play, especially in his strained relationship
        with his brother, Oliver. His love for Rosalind drives much of the
        plot's action.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Oliver Role: Orlando’s older brother, who initially treats Orlando
        cruelly and with envy. Oliver conspires to have Orlando killed but later
        experiences a change of heart when Orlando saves his life in the forest.
        Characteristics: At first, Oliver is envious, manipulative, and
        antagonistic toward Orlando. He withholds Orlando’s inheritance and even
        plots his brother's death. However, after being saved by Orlando, Oliver
        undergoes a significant transformation, becoming kind and remorseful.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Duke Senior Role: Rosalind’s father and the rightful Duke of the
        court. He has been exiled by his younger brother, Duke Frederick, and
        lives in the Forest of Arden with his loyal followers. Characteristics:
        Duke Senior is depicted as wise, kind, and philosophical. Even in exile,
        he maintains a positive outlook on life, finding solace in the
        simplicity and freedom of the forest. He is a benevolent leader and a
        loving father to Rosalind.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Duke Frederick Role: The villain of the play, Duke Frederick is the
        younger brother of Duke Senior. He usurps Duke Senior’s position,
        exiling him and taking over his dukedom. He also banishes Rosalind,
        despite her being his niece. Characteristics: Duke Frederick is
        power-hungry, tyrannical, and ruthless. He is driven by jealousy and
        ambition, showing little regard for familial bonds. His harsh and
        arbitrary actions set much of the plot in motion. However, like many
        characters in the play, he too undergoes a change, repenting and
        renouncing his wrongdoings by the end of the play.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Charles Role: The court wrestler who is loyal to Duke Frederick. He
        is manipulated by Oliver to harm Orlando during their wrestling match,
        but Orlando ultimately defeats him. Characteristics: Charles is strong,
        competitive, and somewhat prideful. Though his role is small, he is
        portrayed as a loyal servant to Duke Frederick and is used by Oliver in
        his plot against Orlando.
