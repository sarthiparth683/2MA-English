      <li><b>CHARACTERISTICS:-</b></li>
      <li>
        1. Edward II is the central figure in the play. He ascends to the throne after his father, Edward I, but is an ineffective and weak ruler. His obsessive
        affection for his favorite, Piers Gaveston, alienates the nobility and his wife, leading to political turmoil. Edward's inability to balance personal
        desires and the responsibilities of kingship ultimately results in his deposition and brutal death.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Piers Gaveston is the king's close companion and lover, and his presence at court causes immense friction between Edward and the nobility. Gaveston’s
        arrogance and manipulation of the king’s favor increase the enmity of the nobles, leading to his eventual capture and execution by the rebellious
        barons. His role highlights Edward's vulnerability and poor judgment in political matters.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Queen Isabella (Edward II’s Wife) initially loyal to Edward, becomes disillusioned by his obsession with Gaveston and later with the Spencers. She
        allies with the nobles against her husband and becomes involved with Mortimer. Together, they orchestrate Edward’s downfall. Her betrayal is driven by
        political necessity as well as personal humiliation.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Edward I (The Late King of England) referred to posthumously, represents the ideal of strong kingship that Edward II fails to live up to. His legacy
        and reign contrast sharply with his son’s weaknesses. Though he never appears in the play, his influence lingers as a standard against which Edward II
        is judged.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Younger Mortimer (Roger Mortimer) is a key nobleman and antagonist to Edward II. Initially loyal, he turns against the king due to his favoritism
        towards Gaveston and the Spencers. Mortimer eventually becomes Queen Isabella’s lover and takes on a leading role in deposing Edward. His ambition and
        ruthlessness drive much of the play’s later action, culminating in his seizure of power.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Elder Mortimer Role: Elder Mortimer is the uncle of Younger Mortimer and also opposes Edward II, though he is a more moderate figure than his nephew.
        He represents the older generation of nobility, and though he initially advises against extreme measures, he ultimately supports the rebellion.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Spencer (Hugh Despenser the Younger) After Gaveston's death, Spencer becomes Edward’s new favorite. Like Gaveston, Spencer is despised by the nobles
        for his influence over the king. His rise to power after Gaveston’s fall further isolates Edward from the barons. Spencer shares Gaveston’s fate, being
        executed by the rebels.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Prince Edward (Edward III)  Prince Edward is the son of Edward II and Queen Isabella. Though still a child for much of the play, he is used as a
        pawn in the political struggles of his parents and the nobles. By the end of the play, he becomes king, ascending the throne as Edward III, signaling a
        new beginning for England after his father’s disastrous reign.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. Earl of Kent (Edmund of Woodstock)  The Earl of Kent is Edward II’s half-brother and initially loyal to him. However, as Edward’s rule becomes
        more unstable, Kent sides with the rebels, only to later feel remorse for his betrayal. He attempts to rescue Edward II from imprisonment but is
        captured and executed for his efforts.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Earl of Warwick Role: Warwick is one of the noblemen who leads the rebellion against Edward II. He is instrumental in the capture and execution of
        Gaveston. Warwick represents the nobility’s frustration with Edward’s favoritism and weak governance.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Earl of Lancaster Role: Lancaster is another prominent baron who opposes Edward II. He supports the rebellion against the king and, along with
        Warwick, plays a key role in the capture of Gaveston. Lancaster’s discontent reflects the broader dissatisfaction among the nobles.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Gourney and Maltravers Role: These two men are entrusted with guarding Edward II after his deposition. They later carry out the king’s murder on the
        orders of the rebel leaders, specifically Mortimer and Isabella. Gourney and Maltravers represent the callous, violent undercurrents of the rebellion.
      </li>
      <li>
        13. Lightborne Role: Lightborne is the assassin sent by Mortimer and Isabella to murder Edward II. His name, which means "bearer of light," is ironic,
        given his dark task. Lightborne carries out the gruesome execution of the king, representing the final act of treachery and violence in the play.
      </li>
      <li>
        14. Lady Margaret de Clare Role: Lady Margaret is a minor character, the wife of Gaveston. Her role is largely symbolic, representing the personal costs
        of the political machinations in the play. Her marriage to Gaveston is a political alliance, and she remains loyal to him even as his fortunes
        deteriorate.
      </li>
      <li>
        15. Bishop of Canterbury Role: The Bishop of Canterbury is a church leader who also opposes Edward II’s rule. His position represents the involvement of
        the Church in the political struggle, reflecting the broader tensions between secular authority and religious influence.
      </li>
      <li>
        16. Nobility (Collectively) Role: The nobility as a collective plays a crucial role in the plot. Discontented with Edward II’s favoritism and poor
        leadership, they rebel against the king. The nobles symbolize the opposition to Edward’s rule and the larger societal demand for strong and just
        governance.
      </li>
      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
        "Edward II" by Christopher Marlowe is a historical play that dramatizes the reign and fall of King Edward II of England. Here's a summary of the story:
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 1 The play begins with Edward II's ascension to the throne after the death of his father. Edward recalls his favorite, Piers Gaveston, from exile
        and showers him with titles and favors, much to the dismay of the nobility. The nobles, particularly Mortimer and Lancaster, resent Gaveston's influence
        and the king's neglect of his royal duties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 2 The tension between the king and the nobles intensifies. The nobles, alongside Queen Isabella (Edward’s wife), conspire against Gaveston. Despite
        Edward's efforts to protect him, Gaveston is eventually captured and executed by the nobles. The death of Gaveston devastates Edward and further
        estranges him from the nobility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 3 Edward II's favoritism continues as he elevates the Despenser family, leading to further conflict with the barons. The queen allies with the
        nobles, including Mortimer, to overthrow the king. Civil war breaks out, and Edward is captured and forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Edward III.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 4 Edward II is imprisoned and subjected to humiliation and harsh treatment. Queen Isabella and Mortimer take control of the kingdom, but their
        relationship becomes strained. Edward’s supporters, including his loyal follower Spencer, are executed. The young Edward III begins to recognize the
        corruption and ambition of Mortimer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act 5 Edward II is moved to Berkeley Castle, where he is brutally murdered on Mortimer’s orders. The young Edward III confronts Mortimer and his mother,
        seizes power, and orders Mortimer’s execution. Queen Isabella is spared but stripped of her power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Themes "Edward II" explores themes of power, favoritism, betrayal, and the consequences of personal desires over political responsibilities. The play
        examines the complex dynamics between rulers and their subjects and the destructive potential of unchecked ambition and favoritism.
      </li>
      <li>
        Significance Marlowe's "Edward II" is notable for its complex characterization and its portrayal of a tragic historical figure. The play highlights the
        vulnerabilities of a king who is torn between personal affection and royal duty, ultimately leading to his downfall.
